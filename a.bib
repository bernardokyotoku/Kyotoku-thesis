title = {Flexural properties of fiber reinforced root canal posts},
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Fiber-reinforced composite (FRC) root canal posts have been introduced to be used instead of metal alloys and ceramics. The aim of this study was to investigate the flexural properties of different types of FRC posts and compare those values with a novel FRC material for dental applications. METHODS: Seventeen different FRC posts of various brands (Snowpost, Carbopost, Parapost, C-post, Glassix, Carbonite) and diameters, (1.0-2.1 mm) and a continuous unidirectional E-glass FRC polymerized by light activation to a cylindrical form (everStick, diameter 1.5 mm) as a control material were tested. The posts (n=5) were stored at room's humidity or thermocycled (12.000 x, 5 degrees C/55 degrees C) and stored in water for 2 weeks before testing. A three-point bending test (span=10 mm) was used to measure the flexural strength and modulus of FRC post specimens. RESULTS: Analysis of ANOVA revealed that thermocycling, brand of material and diameter of specimen had a significant effect (p<0.001) on the fracture load and flexural strength. The highest flexural strength was obtained with the control material (everStick, 1144.9+/-99.9 MPa). There was a linear relationship between fracture load and diameter of posts for both glass fiber and carbon fiber posts. Thermocycling decreased the flexural modulus of the tested specimens by approximately 10%. Strength and fracture load decreased approximately 18% as a result of thermocycling. SIGNIFICANCE: Considerable variation can be found in the calculated strength values of the studied post brands. Commercial prefabricated FRC posts showed lower flexural properties than an individually polymerised FRC material.},

title = {Optical coherence tomography - principles and applications},
abstract = {There have been three basic approaches to optical tomography since the early 1980s: diffraction tomography, diffuse optical tomography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Optical techniques are of particular importance in the medical field, because these techniques promise to be safe and cheap and, in addition, offer a therapeutic potential. Advances in OCT technology have made it possible to apply OCT in a wide variety of applications but medical applications are still dominating. Specific advantages of OCT are its high depth and transversal resolution, the fact, that its depth resolution is decoupled from transverse resolution, high probing depth in scattering media, contact-free and non-invasive operation, and the possibility to create various function dependent image contrasting methods. This report presents the principles of OCT and the state of important OCT applications. OCT synthesises cross-sectional images from a series of laterally adjacent depth-scans. At present OCT is used in three different fields of optical imaging, in macroscopic imaging of structures which can be seen by the naked eye or using weak magnifications, in microscopic imaging using magnifications up to the classical limit of microscopic resolution and in endoscopic imaging, using low and medium magnification. First, OCT techniques, like the reflectometry technique and the dual beam technique were based on time-domain low coherence interferometry depth-scans. Later, Fourier-domain techniques have been developed and led to new imaging schemes. Recently developed parallel OCT schemes eliminate the need for lateral scanning and, therefore, dramatically increase the imaging rate. These schemes use CCD cameras and CMOS detector arrays as photodetectors. Video-rate three-dimensional OCT pictures have been obtained. Modifying interference microscopy techniques has led to high-resolution optical coherence microscopy that achieved sub-micrometre resolution. This report is concluded with a short presentation of important OCT applications. Ophthalmology is, due to the transparent ocular structures, still the main field of OCT application. The first commercial instrument too has been introduced for ophthalmic diagnostics (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG). Advances in using near-infrared light, however, opened the path for OCT imaging in strongly scattering tissues. Today, optical in vivo biopsy is one of the most challenging fields of OCT application. High resolution, high penetration depth, and its potential for functional imaging attribute to OCT an optical biopsy quality, which can be used to assess tissue and cell function and morphology in situ. OCT can already clarify the relevant architectural tissue morphology. For many diseases, however, including cancer in its early stages, higher resolution is necessary. New broad-bandwidth light sources, like photonic crystal fibres and superfluorescent fibre sources, and new contrasting techniques, give access to new sample properties and unmatched sensitivity and resolution.},

In this study, we investigate optical coherence tomography (OCT) as an imaging modality to monitor non-invasively both structures and cells in engineered tissue constructs. We employ time-domain OCT to visualize macro-structural morphology, and whole-field optical coherence microscopy to delineate the morphology of cells and constructs in a developing in vitro engineered bone tissue. The results show great potential for the use of OCT in non-invasive monitoring of cellular activities in 3D developing engineered tissues.},

title = {Noninvasive assessment of the developing Xenopus cardiovascular system using optical coherence tomography},
abstract = {Studies investigating normal and abnormal cardiac development are frequently limited by an inability to assess cardiovascular function within the intact organism. In this work, optical coherence tomography (OCT), a new method of micron-scale, noninvasive imaging based on the measurement of backscattered infrared light, was introduced for the high resolution assessment of structure and function in the developing Xenopus laevis cardiovascular system. Microstructural details, such as ventricular size and wall positions, were delineated with OCT at 16-microm resolution and correlated with histology. Three-dimensional representation of the cardiovascular system also was achieved by repeated cross-sectional imaging at intervals of 25 microm. In addition to structural information, OCT provides high speed in vivo axial ranging and imaging, allowing quantitative dynamic activity, such as ventricular ejection fraction, to be assessed. The sensitivity of OCT for dynamic assessment was demonstrated with an inotropic agent that altered cardiac function and dimensions. Optical coherence tomography is an attractive new technology for assessing cardiovascular development because of its high resolution, its ability to image through nontransparent structures, and its inexpensive portable design. In vivo and in vitro imaging are performed at a resolution approaching that of histopathology without the need for animal killing.},

title = {Influence of water exposure on the tensile strength of composites},
abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate whether water storage causes permanent damage to composites by determining how the tensile strength of nine different composite materials changes with both water storage and water storage followed by dehydration. Eighteen samples (ASTM-D Specification 1708-66) of each of the nine materials were prepared and divided into three groups of six samples each. Group I was stored dry at 60 degrees C, while Groups II and III were stored in distilled water at 60 degrees C. After six months, Groups I and II were subjected to tensile testing, while Group III was transferred to a desiccator and dehydrated for two weeks at 60 degrees C before this group was tested in tension. Mean values, pooled by storage group independent of material, revealed a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction in strength for both Groups II and III relative to Group I. These findings prove that water has an irreversible effect on most dental composites. A comparison of Group II with Group III data revealed that the samples which were aged in water and tested (Group II) were significantly (p less than 0.05) weaker than the dehydrated samples (Group III). However, some products within Group III did not show any tendency to recover their strength after dehydration.},

title = {Evaluation of sub-critical fatigue crack propagation in a restorative composite},
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Fracture is a major reason for clinical failure of dental restorations. Many clinical fractures are likely to be preceded by a slow sub-critical crack propagation. The purpose of this study was to determine slow crack propagation in a restorative composite. METHODS: Notched composite (Z100, 3M ESPE) specimens were fatigued in a four-point bending test. The notch (1 mm) was created by embedding a sharpened razor blade in the specimen mold. The specimens were load-cycled at 5 Hz between -5 and -30 N until failure. Displacement and load were recorded during the fatigue tests and used to derive crack propagation based on beam-compliance. RESULTS: The number of cycles until failure ranged between 34 and 82,481. In the last 1500 cycles prior to final fracture, the beam compliance increased consistently, indicating sub-critical crack propagation. It was calculated from the compliance change that the crack length increased 8% (77 +/- 14 microm) before final failure. The crack growth rate during sub-critical crack propagation was determined as a function of the stress intensity for the last 1500 cycles before fracture. SIGNIFICANCE: A method is presented to determine slow crack propagation using a four-point bending test. Although fatigue lifetime varied widely, stable crack growth prior to fracture was consistent. This consistency allowed formulation of stress-based crack propagation relationships that can be used in concert with numerical simulations to predict composite restoration performance. The large variation found for specimen lifetime was attributed to the initiation process that precedes sub-critical crack propagation.},

For the most part, these methods have been demonstrated in laboratories and are generally many years away from routine clinical application. They include multi-photon imaging, infrared thermography and infrared fluorescence, optical coherence tomography, ultrasound, and terahertz imaging.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Optical coherence tomography, or OCT, is a new diagnostic imaging technique that has many potential dental applications. The authors present the first intraoral dental images made using this technology. METHODS: The authors constructed a prototype dental OCT system. This system creates cross-sectional images by quantifying the reflections of infrared light from dental structures interferometrically. RESULTS: We used our prototype system to make dental OTC images of healthy adults in a clinical setting. These OCT images depicted both hard and soft oral tissues at high resolution. CONCLUSIONS: OCT images exhibit microstructural detail that cannot be obtained with current imaging modalities. Using this new technology, visual recordings of periodontal tissue contour, secular depth and connective tissue attachment now are possible. The internal aspects and marginal adaptation of porcelain and composite restorations can be visualized. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: There are several advantages of OCT compared with conventional dental imaging. This new imaging technology is safe, versatile, inexpensive and readily adapted to a clinical dental environment.},

title = {Microleakage of class V cavities with different adhesive systems prepared by a diamond instrument and different parameters of Er:YAG laser irradiation},
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the microleakage of composite resin restorations using two different dentine adhesive systems prepared with a diamond instrument and different parameters of Er:YAG laser irradiation. BACKGROUND DATA: Information on this topic with regard to preparing class V cavities with different parameters of Er:YAG laser irradiation and adhesive systems is scarce. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred class V cavities were assigned to ten groups (n = 20 each): group 1: Er:YAG laser (5 Hz, 600 mJ) + phosphoric acid (PA) + Adper Single Bond 2 (ASB2); group 2: Er:YAG laser (10 Hz, 300 mJ) + PA + ASB2; group 3: Er:YAG laser (15 Hz, 200 mJ) + PA + ASB2; group 4: Er:YAG laser (20 Hz, 150 mJ) + PA + ASB2; group 5: diamond instrument + PA + ASB2; group 6: Er:YAG laser (5 Hz, 600 mJ) + Adper Prompt L-Pop (APLP); group 7: Er:YAG laser (10 Hz, 300 mJ) + APLP; group 8: Er:YAG laser (15 Hz, 200 mJ) + APLP; group 9: Er:YAG laser (20 Hz, 150 mJ) + APLP; and group 10: diamond instrument + APLP. Cavities were restored with a nanofill composite (Filtek Supreme XT Body). After thermocycling, the specimens were stained with 0.5% aqueous basic fuchsin dye and sectioned bucco-lingually. Dye penetration was then scored. The data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests with Bonferroni correction. The Wilcoxon signed ranks test was used to compare occlusal and gingival scores. RESULTS: Leakage was seen in all groups at both the occlusal and gingival margins. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed statistically significant differences among the 10 groups (p < 0.001). The gingival margins had more microleakage than the occlusal margins (p < 0.001). Pairwise analysis by the Mann-Whitney U test showed that statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in microleakage were found between groups 3 and 5 (3 > 5), 5 and 7 (7 > 5), and 7 and 8 (7 > 8) at the gingival margin, and between groups 3 and 6 (6 > 3), 3 and 7 (7 > 3), 4 and 6 (6 > 4), and 4 and 7 (7 > 4) at the occlusal margin. CONCLUSION: We concluded that for all groups, microleakage values were higher at the gingival margins. The use of the Er:YAG laser for cavity preparation with different parameters and different dentine adhesive systems influenced the marginal sealing of composite resin restorations.},

abstract = {New imaging technologies are needed for the early detection of dental caries (decay) in the interproximal contact sites between teeth. Previous measurements have demonstrated that dental enamel is highly transparent in the near-IR at 1300-nm. In this study, a near-IR imaging system operating at 1300-nm was used to acquire images through tooth sections of varying thickness and whole teeth in order to demonstrate the utility of a near-IR dental transillumination system for the imaging of early dental caries (decay). Simulated lesions, which model the optical scattering of natural dental caries, were placed in plano-parallel dental enamel sections. The contrast ratio between the simulated lesions and surrounding sound enamel was calculated from analysis of acquired projection images. The results show significant contrast between the lesion and the enamel (>0.35) and a spatial line profile that clearly resolves the lesion in samples as thick as 6.75-mm. This study clearly demonstrates that a near-IR transillumination system has considerable potential for the imaging of early dental decay.},

title = {Fractography: determining the sites of fracture initiation},
abstract = {Fractography is the analysis of fracture surfaces. Here, it refers to quantitative fracture surface analysis (FSA) in the context of applying the principles of fracture mechanics to the topography observed on the fracture surface of brittle materials. The application of FSA is based on the principle that encoded on the fracture surface of brittle materials is the entire history of the fracture process. It is our task to develop the skills and knowledge to decode this information. There are several motivating factors for applying our knowledge of FSA. The first and foremost is that there is specific, quantitative information to be obtained from the fracture surface. This information includes the identification of the size and location of the fracture initiating crack or defect, the stress state at failure, the existence, or not, of local or global residual stress, the existence, or not, of stress corrosion and a knowledge of local processing anomalies which affect the fracture process. The second motivating factor is that the information is free. Once a material is tested to failure, the encoded information becomes available. If we decide to observe the features produced during fracture then we are rewarded with much information. If we decide to ignore the fracture surface, then we are left to guess and/or reason as to the cause of the failure without the benefit of all of the possible information available. This paper addresses the application of quantitative fracture surface analysis to basic research, material and product development, and "trouble-shooting" of in-service failures. First, the basic principles involved will be presented. Next, the methodology necessary to apply the principles will be presented. Finally, a summary of the presentation will be made showing the applicability to design and reliability.},

title = {Fatigue strength of fragmented incisal edges restored with a fiber reinforced restorative material},
abstract = {AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the compressive fatigue limits (CFLs) of fractured incisor teeth restored using either a conventional adhesive-composite technique or using fiber-reinforced composites (FRCs). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifteen extracted sound upper incisor teeth were prepared by cutting away the incisal one-third part of their crowns horizontally. The teeth were restored using three techniques. Group A (control group) was restored by reattaching the original incisal edge to the tooth. Group B was restored using particulate filler composite (PFC). Group C was restored with PFC and FRC by adding a thin layer of FRC to the palatal surface of the teeth. The bonding system used was a conventional etch system with primer and adhesive. All restored teeth were stored in water at room temperature for 24 h before they were loaded under a cyclic load with a maximum controlled regimen using a universal testing machine. The test employed a staircase approach with a maximum of 103 cycles or until failure occurred. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) (p=0.05). Failure modes were visually examined. RESULTS: Group A (reattaching fractured incisal edge) revealed the lowest CFL values, whereas the creation of a new incisal edge with PFC revealed a 152% higher CFL value compared to Group A. Group C (teeth restored with FRC) revealed a 352% higher CFL than the control group. ANOVA revealed the restoration technique significantly affected the compressive fatigue limit (p<0.001). The failure mode in Group A and B was debonding of the restoration from the adhesive interface. While in Group C, the sample teeth fractured below their cemento-enamel junctions. CONCLUSION: These results suggested an incisally fractured tooth restored with the combination of PFC and FRC-structure provided the highest CFL.},

title = {Influence of patient factors on age of restorations at failure and reasons for their placement and replacement},
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study examined the reasons given by a selected group of dental practitioners for placement and replacement of restorations and correlated the data provided with patient factors, such as patients' age and gender, caries risk, occlusal function and oral hygiene, with restoration longevity. METHOD: A group of general dental practitioners (GDPs) were recruited to take part in the study. Each participant was asked to record the reason for placement or replacement of restorations from a list of potential reasons. The age and Class of the restoration being replaced was also recorded, as also was the material being used and the material being replaced. RESULTS: Details of reason for placement/replacement was received on 3196 restorations from 32 GDPs. Of the restorations placed, 54% were amalgam, 32% composite, 8% compomer and 7% glass ionomer. The reasons for placement/replacement of the restorations were principally primary caries (28%), secondary caries (29%), margin fracture (10%), tooth fracture (7%), and non-carious defects (6%). Overall, the mean age of restorations at failure was 7.1 years. Of the patients who received glass ionomer restorations, 29% were rated as having poor oral hygiene, compared with 18% of the patients who received amalgam restorations, 18% of the patients who received composite restorations and 23% of the patients who received compomer restorations. Of the patients who received glass ionomer restorations, 35% were rated as having high caries susceptibility, compared with 27% of those receiving amalgam restorations, 21% of those receiving composite restorations and 30% of those receiving compomer restorations. CONCLUSION: Primary caries was the principal reason for initial restorations. Secondary caries was the most prevalent reason for replacement of restorations. The results also indicate a selective application of different materials for different patients.},

title = {Fatigue resistance of removable orthodontic appliance reinforced with glass fibre weave},
abstract = {The aim of this study was to measure the fatigue resistance of fibre-reinforced composite (FRC) reinforced polymeric parts of a removable orthodontic appliance beside the clasp. The effect of quantity and position of FRC-reinforcement were investigated. In addition, the influence of water storage on the fatigue properties was determined. The test specimens for eight groups (n=6) were manufactured from autopolymerizing acrylic resin. Polymethylmethacrylate pre-impregnated woven glass fibre was used as reinforcement of acrylic resin specimens at the region of steel wire clasp. The test specimens of the control group were not reinforced. In the second group, the test specimens were reinforced with one fibre layer (thickness: 0.06 mm) on the tension side, and in the third and fourth group with two fibre layers. Fatigue resistance was measured by applying repeated bending force to the clasp. The highest fatigue resistance values were achieved when the test specimens were fibre-reinforced with two fibre layers. The lowest fatigue resistance values resulted when the test specimens were not reinforced (P=0.046, anova). Water storage had a tendency to decrease the fatigue resistance in all fibre reinforced test specimen groups. The results suggest that use of the woven polymer pre-impregnated glass FRC-reinforcement increases the fracture resistance of orthodontic appliance made of acrylic polymer.},

abstract = {A detailed understanding of the complexity of root canal systems is imperative to ensure successful root canal therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of an optical coherence tomography (OCT) system in imaging root canal walls after endodontic preparation and to correlate these images to histologic sections. Ten extracted mandibular incisors were prepared to size 50 with K-files and Gates Glidden drills. A three-dimensional OCT scan was made with a rotating optical fiber probe inside the root canal. All teeth were sectioned at 5 and 7 mm from the apex and viewed through a microscope. Histologic sections were compared with the corresponding OCT output. All oval canals, uncleaned fins, risk zones, and one perforation that was detected by histology were also imaged by OCT. OCT proves to be a reliable method to image root canals and root dentin in a nondestructive way. This technique holds promise for full in vivo endodontic imaging.},

abstract = {Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique, which has previously demonstrated potential for use in dermatology. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate how improvements in image quality, speed, and functionality enable qualitative and quantitative information to be obtained from in vivo human skin. We developed a portable fiber-optic based OCT imaging device that requires only 1 second to simultaneously provide high-resolution images of skin structure, collagen birefringence, and blood flow. Images of normal human skin were acquired in vivo, and features compared with clinical and histologic observations. The layered structure and appendages of skin were apparent in conventional OCT images, and correlated well with corresponding histology. Polarization-sensitive OCT images simultaneously revealed birefringent regions within the dermis corresponding to the location of collagen fibers, as confirmed with polarized light microscopy. Properties of collagen-rich tissues including tendon and scar tissues were quantified. Location of blood flow was also displayed alongside structural and polarization-sensitive images. Significant improvements in OCT technology have been made since its early application in dermatology. In particular, combining the previously described structural and Doppler imaging functions with polarization-sensitive imaging increases the utility of the technique for rapid, non-invasive investigations in the skin.},

METHODS: Bar specimens (2mm x 3mm x 25mm) of fiber reinforced composite were mechanically and thermally cycled to emulate oral conditions. The interior of these samples was analyzed prior to and after loading, using OCT. The device used was a home-built Fourier domain OCT setup working at 800 nm with 6 microm spatial resolution. RESULTS: Intact specimens after load cycling were analyzed. It was clearly seen that OCT images provide an insight into crack propagation, which is not seen by the naked eye. SIGNIFICANCE: By using OCT the possibility of analyzing the fracture propagation quantitatively, and in depth, was added, opening up possibilities to quantitative studies.},

title = {Postoperative pulpal and repair responses},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Each year in the United States, the success of 10 million surgically restored carious lesions depends on a favorable tertiary dentin repair response to preparation, restoration and patient factor variables. The authors investigated the relationship between these variables and dentinal response. METHODS: Standardized rectangular Class V restoration preparations were cut into the buccal dentin of intact first or second premolars of 27 patients without exposing the pulp and were restored. The patients were between 9 and 17 years of age. The treated teeth were scheduled for extraction for orthodontic reasons. After tooth extraction, the tertiary dentin was analyzed histomorphometrically. RESULTS: The area of tertiary reactionary dentin was found to be correlated using linear regression analysis of variance with restoration residual dentin thickness (P = .0024), age of the patient (P = .0045), restoration floor surface area (P = .0266) and restoration width (P = .0415). The authors did not find a correlation with the premolar position (P = .0594), sex of the patient (P = .650), pulpal inflammatory reaction (P = .613) or the time elapsed since surgery (P = .531). Restoration with zinc oxide eugenol was found to negatively influence tertiary dentin matrix secretion (post hoc analysis of variance, P = .030). CONCLUSIONS: The age of a patient at treatment, the choice of restorative material and the size of the restoration preparation are all factors that can positively or negatively affect the pulpal repair response. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Age of the patient affects dentin repair capacity and may be a factor in treatment planning decisions. Minimizing the cutting of dentin, especially the width and base of the preparation, reduces the probability of recurrent pulpal complications.},

title = {Human pulp response after an adhesive system application in deep cavities},
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the pulpo-dentin complex response to a dentin adhesive application in deep cavities performed in human teeth. METHODS: Deep class V cavities were prepared on the buccal surface of 46 premolars. The remaining dentin of the axial wall received 10% phosphoric acid and dentin adhesive (group DA), or was protected before the acid and dentin adhesive application with calcium hydroxide cement (group CH). Half of the teeth, which received the acid application directly over the axial wall, were contaminated prior to the procedures with dental plaque collected from the patient's own teeth (group DAC). The plaque was placed on the dentin for 5 min and then the cavity was washed. All teeth were restored with a light-cured composite resin. The teeth were extracted after 7, 30 or 60 days and prepared according to normal histologic techniques. Serial sections were stained with H/E, Masson's trichrome and Brown {\&} Brenn technique for demonstration of bacteria. RESULTS: The histopathologic evaluation showed that in groups DA and DAC, the inflammatory response was more evident than in group CH. Also, the intensity of the pulp reaction increased as the remaining dentin thickness decreased. There was no statistical difference in the inflammatory response between the groups DA and DAC. CONCLUSION: Based on the experimental conditions, we concluded that the All Bond 2 adhesive system, when applied on dentin in deep cavities, showed an acceptable biocompatibility. However, the intensity of the pulpo-dentin complex response depends on the remaining dentin thickness.},

title = {Shedding new light on early caries detection},
abstract = {Dental caries continues to be a common chronic disease among various population groups. Patient care can be improved with detection at the earliest stage. However, current techniques do not have sufficient sensitivity and specificity. We discuss 2 new methods - optical coherence tomography (OCT) and polarized Raman spectroscopy (PRS) - that are potentially useful for early caries detection and monitoring. OCT produces morphologic depth images of near-surface tissue structures with a resolution that is an order of magnitude greater than ultrasound imaging. Based on measurement of back-scattered near infrared light, OCT shows that sound enamel causes high-intensity back-scattering at the tooth surface that decreases rapidly with depth. In contrast, incipient lesions cause higher light back-scattering at the tooth surface and subsurface scattering indicative of porosity caused by demineralization. The scatter region within the enamel correlates well with the classical triangular shape of subsurface lesions observed in histologic sections. OCT imaging not only allows identification of incipient lesions, but also provides information on surface integrity and lesion depth. PRS furnishes biochemical information about the tooth"s composition, mineral content and crystallinity. The depolarization ratio derived from the dominant phosphate peak of hydroxyapatite in sound teeth is consistently lower than that from incipient caries. This difference is attributed to the change in enamel crystallite morphology or orientation that occurs with acid demineralization. Thus, PRS can be used to confirm suspect lesions determined by OCT and rule out false-positive signals from non-carious anomalies. The combination of OCT and PRS provides a new detection method with high sensitivity and specificity that will improve caries management and patient care. Future studies are aimed at developing intraoral probes to validate the findings in vivo.},

title = {Dentine bond strength and microleakage of flowable composite, compomer and glass ionomer cement},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: To assess in vitro the dentine bond strength and microleakage of three Class V restorations viz. flowable composite, compomer and glass ionomer cement. METHODS: Eighteen dentine specimens were prepared and randomly distributed among three groups. Three kinds of restoration materials were each bonded on prepared dentine surfaces in three groups as per the manufacturers' instructions. Group Aelite: Tyrian SPE (a no-rinse, self-priming etchant) + One Step Plus (an universal dental adhesive) + Aeliteflo (a flowable composite); Group Dyract: Prime {\&} Bond NT (a no-rinse, self-priming dental adhesive) + Dyract AP (a compomer); Group GlasIonomer: GlasIonomer Type II (a self-cured restorative glass ionomer). Fifteen dentine/restoration microtensile bond test specimens were prepared from each group and were subjected to microtensile bond strength testing. The bond interfaces were observed morphologically using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Twenty-four cervical cavities of 4.0 mm mesiodistal length, 2.0 mm occlusogingival height and 1.5 mm depth were prepared at the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) on both buccal and lingual surfaces of each tooth. The cavities were each filled with flowable composite (Group Aelite), compomer (Group Dyract) and glass ionomer cement (Group GlasIonomer) using the same material and methods as for the microtensile bond tests. Microleakage of each restoration was evaluated by the ratio of the length of methylene blue penetration along the tooth-restoration interface and the total length of the dentine cavity wall on the cut surface. RESULTS: One-way ANOVA and least significant difference (LSD) tests revealed statistically significant differences among the dentine bond strength for Group Aelite (28.4 MPa), Group Dyract (15.1 MPa) and Group GlasIonomer (2.5 MPa). SEM images showed intimate adaptation in the restoration/dentine interfaces of Group Aelite and Group Dyract. All of the systems tested in this study presented microleakage. However, both Group Aelite (0.808) and Group Dyract (0.863) had significantly less microleakage than Group GlasIonomer (0.964). There were no statistically significant microleakage differences between Group Aelite and Group Dyract, and no statistically significant microleakage differences between the occlusal margin and gingival margin. CONCLUSIONS: None of the systems tested in this study completely eliminated microleakage. However, both the flowable composite and compomer provided stronger dentine bond strengths and better margin sealing than the conventional glass ionomer cement. Occlusal forces exerted the same effects on microleakage of the occlusal margin and gingival margin in cervical cavities.},
