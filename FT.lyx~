\begin_layout Standard
Diffraction grating is an optical component with a periodic structure.
 This component is of interest becaus any light beam that strike it, is
 defleted into discrete angles that depends on the light wavelength.
 If the light is composed of light of different wavelengths.
 A diffraction grating would send each component to a different direction.
 Allowing us to estimate the amount of light of each wavelength.
 This effect resambles a Fourier analysis where the harmonic component of
 a function is evaluated.
 Here we shall show that such resemblance is not fortuitous.
 What the limitations of such resemblance are.

We can show that a diffraction grating perform such an operation, in fact,
 we imply that any filtering device performs this operation.
 First we shall observe that the above operation is performed over a infinite
 range.
 Which is not possible practically.
 We shall then analyse the case if the integration is done in a time span
 
\begin_inset Formula $T$

, this change however introduces a degree of freedom to what the starting
 time of integration, the integral is no more unique.
 We shall then index each integral by the integration starting point, leading
 us to

To stabilish the terminology we give a brief review of diffraction theory.
 Starting with Huygens principle that states that each point of a wavefront
 is a new wave source.
 With such principle in mind.
 The problem of the diffraction by a small aperture, depicted at figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:aperture"

\end_inset

, can seen in the following way.
 If wave are generated by a point source 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{0}$
\end_inset

 at a point 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 the wave field should be
\begin_inset Formula \[
E\left(Q\right)=E\left(P_{0}\right)\frac{e^{ikr}}{r},\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 the distance between 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is the wavenumber.
 The field at a point 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 due to source at 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is then
\begin_inset Formula \[
E\left(P\right)=E\left(P_{0}\right)\frac{e^{ikr}}{r}\frac{e^{iks}}{s}K\left(\chi\right),\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $K\left(\chi\right)$
\end_inset

 an inclination factor which describes the variation with direction of the
 amplitude of the secondary waves, 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 been the angle between the primary wavefront normal and the direction of
 
\begin_inset Formula $QP$
\end_inset

.
 The at 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 due to all wave sources at surface 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 will then be
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
E\left(P\right)=E\left(P_{0}\right)\int_{S}\frac{e^{ikr}}{r}\frac{e^{iks}}{s}K\left(\chi\right)dS.\label{eq:huygens formula}\end{equation}

 Using Green's theorem on the time-independent wave equation
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\nabla^{2}+k^{2}\right)E=0,\]

\end_inset

 one can derive that
\begin_inset Formula \[
E\left(P\right)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{S}\left[E\left(Q\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial n}\left(\frac{e^{iks}}{s}\right)-\frac{e^{iks}}{s}\frac{\partial E}{\partial n}\left(Q\right)\right]dS,\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial/\partial n$
\end_inset

 is the differentiation along the normal to 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 This one form of the integral theorem of Helmoktz and Kirchhoff.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial}{\partial n}\left(\frac{e^{iks}}{s}\right)=\frac{e^{iks}ik}{s}\left[1-\frac{1}{iks}\right]\cos\left(n,s\right)$
\end_inset

, considering that 
\begin_inset Formula $ks\gg1$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \[
E\left(P\right)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{S}\frac{e^{iks}}{s}\left[ikE\left(Q\right)\cos\left(n,s\right)-\frac{\partial E}{\partial n}\left(Q\right)\right]dS,\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a point source at 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{0}$
\end_inset

 the field at 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left(Q\right)=E\left(P_{0}\right)\frac{e^{iks}}{s}$
\end_inset

.
 The Fresnel-Kirchoff formula will be
\begin_inset Formula \[
E\left(P\right)=\int_{S}E\left(P_{0}\right)\frac{-ik}{4\pi}\frac{e^{ikr}}{r}\frac{e^{iks}}{s}\left[\cos\left(n,r\right)-\cos\left(n,s\right)\right]dS,\]

\end_inset

 Which is known as the Fresnel-Kirchhoff diffraction formula.
 since 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos\left(n,r\right)=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(n,s\right)=\pi-\chi$
\end_inset

 the above integral is
\begin_inset Formula \[
E\left(P\right)=E\left(P_{0}\right)\int_{S}\frac{e^{ikr}}{r}\frac{e^{iks}}{s}\frac{-ik}{4\pi}\left(1+\cos\chi\right)dS.\]

\end_inset

 Which validates the Huygens principle.
 Comparing with 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:huygens formula"

\end_inset

 we note that
\begin_inset Formula \[
K\left(\chi\right)=\frac{-ik}{4\pi}\left(1+\cos\chi\right).\]

\begin_layout Standard
A special case of the Fresnell-Kirchhoff diffraction formula is the Fraunhofer
 diffraction, in this case, the diffracting element is much smaller than
 the distances where the field is being evaluated.
 Figure X, depict such case.
 Where the assumption is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{W}{r}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{W}{s}\ll1$
\end_inset

.
 In such case we have that
\begin_inset Formula \[
s'\approx s+\xi\sin\theta\]

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula \[
r'\approx r+\xi\sin\theta_{0}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which will cause the Fresnel-Kirchhoff formula to be approximated to
\begin_inset Formula \[
E\left(P\right)=C\int_{-W/2}^{W/2}e^{ik\xi\left(\sin\theta_{0}+\sin\theta\right)}d\xi,\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $C=E\left(P_{0}\right)\frac{-ik}{4\pi}\frac{e^{ikr}}{r}\frac{e^{iks}}{s}\left(\cos\theta-\cos\theta_{0}\right)$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \[
E_{\text{aperture}}=CW\text{sinc}\left[\left(\sin\theta_{0}+\sin\theta\right)\frac{Wk}{2\pi}\right].\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a grating with period 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 and aperture 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 the integral will be
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{n}\int_{nd-W/2}^{nd+W/2}e^{ik\xi\left(\sin\theta_{0}+\sin\theta\right)}d\xi,\]

\end_inset

 with transformation of variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi=\xi'-nd$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{n}\int_{-W/2}^{W/2}e^{ik\left(\xi'-nd\right)\left(\sin\theta_{0}+\sin\theta\right)}d\xi'\]

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{-W/2}^{W/2}e^{ik\xi'\left(\sin\theta_{0}+\sin\theta\right)}d\xi'\sum_{n}e^{-iknd\left(\sin\theta_{0}+\sin\theta\right)}\]

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula \[
E_{\text{grating}}=E_{\text{aperture}}\sum_{n}e^{-iknd\left(\sin\theta_{0}+\sin\theta\right)},\]

\end_inset

 Hence 
\begin_inset Formula \[
I=\left|E\right|^{2}=I_{\text{aperture}}\left\{ \frac{\sin\left[N\frac{kd}{2}\left(\sin\theta_{0}+\sin\theta\right)\right]}{\sin\left[\frac{kd}{2}\left(\sin\theta_{0}+\sin\theta\right)\right]}\right\} ^{2}\]

A diffraction grating may be defined as any arrangement which imposes on
 an incident wave a periodic variation of amplitude of phase, or both.
 We may characterize any particular grating by its 
\emph on
transmission function
\emph default

, defined as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let a transparent or semitransparent object (not necessarily periodic) cover
 a portion of a fictitious reference plane 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi\eta$
\end_inset

, and let it be illuminated by a plane monochromatic wave incident in a
 direction specified by the direction cosines 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Fig illustrates the arrangement, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

-axis being perpendicular to the plane of he drawing.
 If no object were present, the disturbance in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi,\eta$
\end_inset

-plane would be represented by the function 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}\left(\xi,\eta\right)=A\exp\left[ik\left(l_{0}\xi+m_{0}\eta\right)\right]$
\end_inset

, the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp\left(-i\omega t\right)$
\end_inset

 being, as usual, omitted.
 Because of the presence of the object disturbance will be modified and
 may be represented by some other function, which we denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $V\left(\xi,\eta\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\emph on
transmission function
\emph default
 of the object is then defined as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
F\left(\xi,\eta\right)=\frac{V\left(\xi,\eta\right)}{V_{0}\left(\xi,\eta\right)}.\end{equation}

\end_inset

 In general 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 depends, not only on 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 but also on the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(l_{0},m_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

 of illumination.
 The transmission function is in general complex, since both the amplitude
 and the phase of the light may be altered on the passing through the object.
 In the special case when the object alters the amplitude but no the phase
 of the incident wave (i.e.
 if arg 
\begin_inset Formula $F\equiv0$
\end_inset

), we speak of an 
\emph on
amplitude object
\emph default
; if it alters the phase but not the amplitude (i.
 e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|F\right|=1$
\end_inset

) we speak of a 
\emph on
phase object
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we are concerned with reflected light rather than with light that is
 transmitted by an object, it is more appropriate to speak of a 
\emph on
reflection function
\emph default
, defined in a similar way, the only difference being that the reference
 plane is on the same side of the object as the incident light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|V/V_{0}\right|$
\end_inset

 is practically unity for points outside the geometrical shadow (whose boundary
 is represented by points A and B in Figure) cast by the object.
 If the portion outside the shadow region is covered by an opaque screen,
 the arrangements act as a diffracting aperture A with a nonuniform pupil
 function.

If the linear dimensions of A are large compared to the wavelength and if
 F remains sensibly constant over regions whose dimensions are of the same
 order as the wavelength, the diffraction formula remain valid under the
 same conditions as before, provided that the integrand of the diffraction

Let us now consider a one-dimensional grating consisting of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 parallel grooves of arbitrary profile, ruled on one surface of a plan-parallel
 glass plate.
 Let the 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi,\eta$
\end_inset

-plane coincide with the plane face of the plate, 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 being the direction of the grooves and let 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 be the period in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume that the direction of propagation of the wave incident upon the grating
 is in the plane of the figure, making an angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $O\zeta$
\end_inset

, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 denote the angle which 
\begin_inset Formula $O\zeta$
\end_inset

 makes with the line joining a very distant point of observation P with
 the grating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As before we set 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{o}=\sin\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $l=\sin\theta$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p=l-l_{0}=\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 The complex amplitude at 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is then immediately obtained from, where the integrand must be multiplied
 by the transmission function 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 of one periodic element.
 We may set 
\begin_inset Formula $q=0$
\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ccc}
\xi_{n}=nd, & \eta_{n}=0 & \left(n=0,1,\ldots,N-1\right)\end{array}.\end{equation}

\end_inset

 We the obtain
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
U\left(p\right)=U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}e^{-ikndp}=U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\frac{1-e^{-iNkdp}}{1-e^{-kdp}},\label{eq: Up}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)=C\int_{A}\! F\left(\xi\right)e^{-ikp\xi}\, d\xi.\label{eq: diffraction envelope}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Hence
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
I\left(p\right)=\left|U\left(p\right)\right|^{2}=\frac{\left(1-e^{-Nkdp}\right)}{\left(1-e^{-kdp}\right)}\cdot\frac{\left(1-e^{Nkdp}\right)}{\left(1-e^{kdp}\right)}\left|U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\right|^{2}=\frac{1-\cos Nkdp}{1-\cos kdp}I^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right),\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $I^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)=\left|U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 If we introduce the function
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
H\left(N,x\right)=\left(\frac{\sin Nx}{\sin x}\right)^{2},\end{equation}

\end_inset

 the formula 5 for the intensity may be written as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
I\left(p\right)=H\left(N,\frac{kdp}{2}\right)I^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right).\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Before discussing the implications of this basic formula we note that according
 to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: Up"

\end_inset

.
 The light distribution is the same as that due to a set of coherent secondary
 sources each characterized by the same amplitude function 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\right|$
\end_inset

 and with phases that differ form each other by integral multiples of 
\begin_inset Formula $kdp$
\end_inset

.
 To see the significance of this phase difference consider two corresponding
 points 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in the neighboring grooves of the grating.
 Since the effect of the grating is to impress a periodic variation onto
 the incident wave, it follows that the path difference between the light
 arriving a 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and at 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is the same as in the absence of the grating, i.e.
 it is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $AK=d\sin\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 denoting the foot of the perpendicular from 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 on to the ray incident at 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Further, the light path from 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 exceeds the light path from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $BL=d\sin\theta$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 being the foot of the perpendicular from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 on to the ray diffracted at 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta.$
\end_inset

 Hence the total path difference between light arriving at the distant point
 of observation form corresponding points in two neighboring grooves is
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
BL-AK=d\left(\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}\right)=dp,\label{eq: path difference}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and the corresponding phase difference is 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi dp/\lambda=kdp$
\end_inset

Formula expresses 
\begin_inset Formula $I\left(p\right)$
\end_inset

 as the product of two functions: one of them, 
\begin_inset Formula $I^{\left(0\right)}$
\end_inset

, represents the effect of a single period of the grating; the other, 
\begin_inset Formula $H\left(N,x\right)$
\end_inset

 has maxima, each of height 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{2}$
\end_inset

 when
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
p\equiv\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}=\frac{m\lambda}{Nd}\left(m=0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots\right),\label{eq:grating equation}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The integer 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 represents, according to 7, the path difference in wavelengths between
 light diffracted in the direction of the maximum, from corresponding points
 in two neighboring grooves.
 In agreement with our earlier definition,7.3.1, we call 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 the 
\emph on
order of interference
\emph default
.
 Between theses principal maxima there are weak secondary maxima (see fig
 8.19a), the first secondary maximum being only a few percent of the principal
 maximum when 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is large.
 The maxima are separated by points of zero intensity at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=kdp/2=\pm n\pi/N$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 in directions given by
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
p\equiv\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}=\frac{n\lambda}{Nd}\left(n=0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots\right)\label{eq: grating secondary maxima}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $n/N$
\end_inset

 is an integer being excluded.

\begin_layout Standard
The function 
\begin_inset Formula $I^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)$
\end_inset

 depends on the form of the grooves.
 Suppose that it has principal maximum for some direction 
\begin_inset Formula $p=p'$
\end_inset

 and that on both sides of the maximum if falls off slowly in comparison
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $I\left(p\right)$
\end_inset

 will have the general form o the sharp maxima near the directions 
\begin_inset Formula $p=m\lambda/d$
\end_inset

.
 Since these directions (except for 
\begin_inset Formula $m=0$
\end_inset

) depend on the wavelength, we see that the grating will decompose a beam
 of non-monochromatic light into 
\emph on
spectral orders
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate these remarks let us consider a grating consisting of a succession
 of long equidistant slits, each of width 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 and length 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

, in an opaque screen.
 If the grating is illuminated from a very distant line source parallel
 to the slits, the intensity 
\begin_inset Formula $I^{\left(0\right)}$
\end_inset

 is given by the expression 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: diffraction envelope"

\end_inset

 (with 
\begin_inset Formula $2a=s$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $2b=L$
\end_inset

) and we obtain
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
I\left(p\right)=\frac{sE}{\lambda R^{2}}\left(\frac{\sin\frac{Nkdp}{2}}{\sin\frac{kdp}{2}}\right)^{2}\left(\frac{\sin\frac{kdp}{2}}{\frac{kdp}{2}}\right)^{2}.\label{eq: diffraction intensity}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Curves representing the two factors in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and their product are shown in fig X.
 The last factor in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: diffraction intensity"

\end_inset

, which represents the effect of a single slit, has a principal maximum
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0$
\end_inset

 and minima given by 
\begin_inset Formula $ksp/2=n\pi$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 at
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
p=\frac{n\lambda}{s},\left(n=0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots\right)\end{equation}

\end_inset

 separated by weak secondary maxima.
 We see that if 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda/s\gg\lambda/d$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 if the width of each slit is small compared to 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, the intensity 
\begin_inset Formula $I\left(p\right)$
\end_inset

 has in addition to a principal maximum at 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0$
\end_inset

 a series of sharp, but progressively decreasing, maxima on either side
 of it, near direction given by 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:grating equation"

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Returning to the general case, it is evident that if the width of each groove
 is very small, of the order of a wavelength (as is often the case in practice)
 the formula derived on the basis of Kirchhoff's approximation, can evidently
 no longer be expected to hold.
 In such cases more refined considerations must be make to determine the
 detailed distribution of the intensity.
 We may, however, expect that the main qualitative features indicated by
 our elementary theory, namely the existence of sharp maxima whose positions
 are substantially determined by the interference function 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

, remain even when the grooves are very narrow, provided, that the intensity
 function of a single period varies slowly in an interval of the order 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p=\lambda/d$
\end_inset

.
 Let us now consider the resolution that may be attained with a grating.
 The separation between a primary maximum of order 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and a neighboring minimum is, according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: grating secondary maxima"

\end_inset

, given by
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\Delta p=\frac{\lambda}{Nd}.\end{equation}

\end_inset

 If the wavelength is changed by an amount 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\lambda$
\end_inset

, the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

th-order maximum is according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:grating equation"

\end_inset

, displaced by an amount
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\Delta'p=\frac{\left|m\right|}{d}\Delta\lambda.\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Assuming that the lines of wavelength 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\pm\frac{1}{2}\Delta\lambda$
\end_inset

 will just be resolved when the maximum of the one wavelength coincides
 with the first minimum of the other we have on he limit of resolution in
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

th order, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p=\Delta'p$
\end_inset

, i.e.
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{\lambda}{\Delta\lambda}=\left|m\right|N.\label{eq: resolving power}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Thus, 
\emph on
the resolving power is equal to the product of the order number m and the
 number N of the grooves
\emph default
.
 For the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

th order we have, according to, that 
\begin_inset Formula $d\left(\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}\right)=m\lambda$
\end_inset

, so that we may also express the resolving power in the form
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{\lambda}{\Delta\lambda}=\frac{Nd\left|\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}\right|}{\lambda}.\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Because of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: path difference"

\end_inset

 this implies that 
\emph on
the resolving power is equal to the number of wavelengths in the path difference
 between rays that are diffracted in the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 from the two extreme ends (separated by distance Nd) of the grating
\emph default
.
 It is to be noted that since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}\right|$
\end_inset

 cannot exceed 2, the resolving power that can be attained with a grating
 of overall with 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 can never exceed the value 
\begin_inset Formula $2w/\lambda$
\end_inset

.
