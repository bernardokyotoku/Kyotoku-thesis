\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is unecessary to emphasize the importance of electronics integrated circuits
 to the current world.
 But it is worth to investigate if it is possible to create the same structure
 in different fields.
 In this investigation one can notice the two crucial feature of the success.
 The use of massivelly parallel device patterning enabled by photolitography
 and the search to decrease device size to its physical limits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three ramification using the microfabrication process have come of age in
 the last decade: Microfluidics, micro-mechanical devices (MEMs) and integrated
 optics.
 Microfluidics enables the possibility of massive chemical analysis which
 revolutionized genetic research, enabling operation such as DNA sequencing
 to be performed at a fraction of time that was done before[citation].
 Micromechanical devices [weinstein thesis].
 Integrated optics which has the potential of large bandwidth data transfer
 and spectroscopic analysis, and possibly quantum processing.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The platform in which optic on chip works consists in the use of a high
 index of refraction material surrounded by a material with lower index
 of refraction to guide light in the higher refrative index material using
 the total internal reflection.
 We call a slab waveguide when a higher refractive index medium is cladded
 by a lower index medium in only dimension.
 Light that is guided in the higher index material can be treated a two
 dimensional wave.
 In this regime, knowledge of free space optics can be applied to design
 devices.
 Components like, lenses, mirrors, concave mirrors, prisms, gratings can
 be readliy visualized[citations][pictures].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another component is wire waveguide, where a high index of refraction material
 is surrounded by lower index material in two dimension.
 This structure transport light like electrons on copper wire.
 This structure is widely used as fiber optics, where system built on fiber
 optics can implemented on chip waveguides.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In chapter we are going to dicuss the physical principles necessary to design
 components in integrated optics.

\begin_layout Standard
We define a slab waveguide as a system comprised of an infinite film (which
 will be also referred as core) of thicknes 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 and index of refraction 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{f}$
\end_inset

 over a substrate with index of refraction 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{s}$
\end_inset

and cladded by a material whose index of refraction is 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{c}$
\end_inset

.
 As stated earlyer the index of refraction in the guiding film needs to
 be greater than its surroundings, this condition is stated in the relation:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
n_{f}>n_{s}\geqslant n_{c}\label{refractiveIndexInequality}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where we left the inequality 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{s}\geqslant n_{c}$
\end_inset

 for sake of generallity and we take the higher index of refraction index
 to be the substrate.

\begin_layout Standard
The Maxwell equation in frequency domain for given system is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\nabla\cdot\epsilon_{0}\epsilon\left(z\right)\mathbf{E}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right) & = & 0\label{1}\\
\nabla\times\mathbf{E\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right)} & = & i\omega\mu_{0}\mathbf{H}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right)\label{eq:3}\\
\nabla\cdot\mu_{0}\mathbf{H\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right)} & = & 0\label{eq:5}\\
\nabla\times\mathbf{H}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right) & = & -i\omega\epsilon_{0}\epsilon\left(z\right)\mathbf{E}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right)\label{eq:5-1}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

where the net charge charge and current density was considered zero, and
 the permeability of the materials was considered to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 The relative dielectric constant in accordance with begining of the section
 is:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\epsilon\left(z\right)=\begin{cases}
n_{c}^{2}, & \text{if }z\ge h\\
n_{f}^{2}, & \text{if }0<z<h\\
n_{s}^{2}, & \text{if }z\le0\end{cases}\label{dielectricFunction}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Substituing the relative dielectric constant on the Maxwell's equation we
 get three sets of Maxwell's equation with a constant dielectric constant:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E}_{j}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right) & = & 0\label{1}\\

\nabla\cdot\mu_{0}\mathbf{H}_{j}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right) & = & 0\label{eq:5}\\
\nabla\times\mathbf{H}_{j}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right) & = & -i\omega n_{j}^{2}\epsilon_{0}\mathbf{E}_{j}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right)\label{eq:5-1}\end{eqnarray}

\begin_layout Standard
Boundary conditions couples a set of Maxwell equations, and therefore its
 solutions, from one region to its neighboring region as follows:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{z}\cdot\left(n_{k}^{2}\mathbf{E}_{k}-n_{j}^{2}\mathbf{E}_{j}\right) & = & 0,\\

 is the unitary vector normal to the interface between different materials.
 Applying the boundary conditions, two sets solutions arise.
 Each set is characterised by the abscence of the transversal component
 of either electric or magnetic field.
 The solution which has no normal component of the magnetic field is called
 TM and the solutions which the normal component of the electric field are
 absent are called TE.

Detector are the conversor from photonics to electronics.
 As with light sources the material which the detector is made of needs
 to be integrated to the rest of the circuit.
 The most used detector type relies on the excitation of electrons from
 the valence band to the conduction band of a semiconductor material, by
 the photons to be detected.
 But other physical effects can be used to make detector.
 [exemples]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Semiconductor detector, nevertheless, are the most used due to its bandwidth,
 limited by the electron mobility which allows bandwidth of [numbers for].
 Sensitivity, (operating in avalanche mode single photons can be detected).
 Simplicity, in metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) the only thing needed is
 the detecting semiconductor material and the metal contacts.
 Depoing the endpoints of the detector creating a PIN structure will allow
 eliminate the need for an external voltage drive.

 Its role on identifying the discrete energy levels of atoms provided a
 significant amount of information to the development of quantum mechanics.

\begin_layout Standard
A diffraction grating may be defined as any arrangement which imposes on
 an incident wave a periodic variation of amplitude of phase, or both.
 We may characterize any particular grating by its 
\emph on
transmission function
\emph default
, defined as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let a transparent or semitransparent object (not necessarily periodic) cover
 a portion of a fictitious reference plane 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi\eta$
\end_inset

, and let it be illuminated by a plane monochromatic wave incident in a
 direction specified by the direction cosines 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Fig illustrates the arrangement, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

-axis being perpendicular to the plane of he drawing.
 If no object were present, the disturbance in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi,\eta$
\end_inset

-plane would be represented by the function 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}\left(\xi,\eta\right)=A\exp\left[ik\left(l_{0}\xi+m_{0}\eta\right)\right]$
\end_inset

, the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp\left(-i\omega t\right)$
\end_inset

 being, as usual, omitted.
 Because of the presence of the object disturbance will be modified and
 may be represented by some other function, which we denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $V\left(\xi,\eta\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\emph on
transmission function
\emph default
 of the object is then defined as
\begin_inset Formula \[
F\left(\xi,\eta\right)=\frac{V\left(\xi,\eta\right)}{V_{0}\left(\xi,\eta\right)}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 depends, not only on 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 but also on the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(l_{0},m_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

 of illumination.
 The transmission function is in general complex, since both the amplitude
 and the phase of the light may be altered on the passing through the object.
 In the special case when the object alters the amplitude but no the phase
 of the incident wave (i.e.
 if arg 
\begin_inset Formula $F\equiv0$
\end_inset

), we speak of an 
\emph on
amplitude object
\emph default
; if it alters the phase but not the amplitude (i.
 e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|F\right|=1$
\end_inset

) we speak of a 
\emph on
phase object
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we are concerned with reflected light rather than with light that is
 transmitted by an object, it is more appropriate to speak of a 
\emph on
reflection function
\emph default
, defined in a similar way, the only difference being that the reference
 plane is on the same side of the object as the incident light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|V/V_{0}\right|$
\end_inset

 is practically unity for points outside the geometrical shadow (whose boundary
 is represented by points A and B in Figure) cast by the object.
 If the portion outside the shadow region is covered by an opaque screen,
 the arrangements act as a diffracting aperture A with a nonuniform pupil
 function.

If the linear dimensions of A are large compared to the wavelength and if
 F remains sensibly constant over regions whose dimensions are of the same
 order as the wavelength, the diffraction formula remain valid under the
 same conditions as before, provided that the integrand of the diffraction
 integral is multiplied by F.

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now consider a one-dimensional grating consisting of n parallel grooves
 of arbitrary profile, ruled on one surface of a plan-parallel glass plate.
 Let the 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi,\eta$
\end_inset

-plane coincide with the plane face of the plate, 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 being the direction of the grooves and let 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 be the period in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume that the direction of propagation of the wave incident upon the grating
 is in the plane of the figure, making an angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $O\zeta$
\end_inset

, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 denote the angle which 
\begin_inset Formula $O\zeta$
\end_inset

 makes with the line joining a very distant point of observation P with
 the grating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As before we set 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{o}=\sin\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $l=\sin\theta$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p=l-l_{0}=\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 The complex amplitude at 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is then immediately obtained from, where the integrand must be multiplied
 by the transmission function 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 of one periodic element.
 We may set 
\begin_inset Formula $q=0$
\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset Formula \[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\xi_{n}=nd, & \eta_{n}=0 & \left(n=0,1,\ldots,N-1\right)\end{array}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We the obtain
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
U\left(p\right)=U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}e^{-ikndp}=U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\frac{1-e^{-iNkdp}}{1-e^{-kdp}},\label{eq: Up}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)=C\int_{A}\! F\left(\xi\right)e^{-ikp\xi}\, d\xi.\label{eq: diffraction envelope}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence
\begin_inset Formula \[
I\left(p\right)=\left|U\left(p\right)\right|^{2}=\frac{\left(1-e^{-Nkdp}\right)}{\left(1-e^{-kdp}\right)}\cdot\frac{\left(1-e^{Nkdp}\right)}{\left(1-e^{kdp}\right)}\left|U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\right|^{2}=\frac{1-\cos Nkdp}{1-\cos kdp}I^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right),\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $I^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)=\left|U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 If we introduce the function
\begin_inset Formula \[
H\left(N,x\right)=\left(\frac{\sin Nx}{\sin x}\right)^{2},\]

\end_inset

 the formula 5 for the intensity may be written as
\begin_inset Formula \[
I\left(p\right)=H\left(N,\frac{kdp}{2}\right)I^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right).\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before discussing the implications of this basic formula we note that according
 to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: Up"

\end_inset

.
 The light distribution is the same as that due to a set of coherent secondary
 sources each characterized by the same amplitude function 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\right|$
\end_inset

 and with phases that differ form each other by integral multiples of 
\begin_inset Formula $kdp$
\end_inset

.
 To see the significance of this phase difference consider two corresponding
 points 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in the neighboring grooves of the grating.
 Since the effect of the grating is to impress a periodic variation onto
 the incident wave, it follows that the path difference between the light
 arriving a 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and at 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is the same as in the absence of the grating, i.e.
 it is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $AK=d\sin\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 denoting the foot of the perpendicular from 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 on to the ray incident at 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Further, the light path from 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 exceeds the light path from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $BL=d\sin\theta$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 being the foot of the perpendicular from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 on to the ray diffracted at 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta.$
\end_inset

 Hence the total path difference between light arriving at the distant point
 of observation form corresponding points in two neighboring grooves is
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
BL-AK=d\left(\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}\right)=dp,\label{eq: path difference}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and the corresponding phase difference is 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi dp/\lambda=kdp$
\end_inset

.

\begin_inset Formula $I\left(p\right)$

 as the product of two functions: one of them,

 Between theses principal maxima there are weak secondary maxima (see fig

 The maxima are separated by points of zero intensity at

The function

 Since these directions (except for

Returning to the general case, it is evident that if the width of each groove
 is very small, of the order of a wavelength (as is often the case in practice)
 the formula derived on the basis of Kirchhoff's approximation, can evidently
 no longer be expected to hold.
 In such cases more refined considerations must be make to determine the
 detailed distribution of the intensity.
 We may, however, expect that the main qualitative features indicated by
 our elementary theory, namely the existence of sharp maxima whose positions
 are substantially determined by the interference function 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

, remain even when the grooves are very narrow, provided, that the intensity
 function of a single period varies slowly in an interval of the order 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p=\lambda/d$
\end_inset

.
 Let us now consider the resolution that may be attained with a grating.
 The separation between a primary maximum of order 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and a neighbouring minimum is, according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Assuming that the lines of wavelength

Thus,

\begin_inset Formula $d\left(\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}\right)=m\lambda$

\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\lambda}{\Delta\lambda}=\frac{Nd\left|\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}\right|}{\lambda}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 this implies that

 It is to be noted that since

\begin_layout Standard
From the resolving power equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, we conclude that spectrometer should be operated on high diffraction order
 so as to minimize the device size for a given resolution.
 Unfortunatelly, the grating equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:grating equation"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p\equiv\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}=\frac{m\lambda}{Nd}$
\end_inset

, we see that it is possible for light from to different wavelength in different
e diffraction orders to be diffracted to the same angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

, sufficing that 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
m_{i}\lambda_{i}=m_{j}\lambda_{j}\]

\end_inset

for 
\begin_inset Formula $i\neq j$
\end_inset

, so for example light diffracted in order 1 at wavelength 1500 nm is diffracted
 in the same direction as light diffracted from order 2 wavelength 750 nm.
 To avoid this ambiguity, it is of interest to know when this condition
 happens.
 From the grating equation we see that 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

 does not make sense outside the interval [0,1], therefore,

\begin_inset Formula $0\le\frac{m\lambda_{m}}{Nd}\le1$

 the wavelength range that is going to be diffracted is:

\begin_inset Formula \[

 below 
\begin_inset Formula $Nd$
\end_inset

 , for order 2 every wavelength below 
\begin_inset Formula $Nd/2$
\end_inset

 and so on.
 We see then, that for order 1 the range

 is occupied solely by order one.
 For order 2 the range

\end_inset

we can replace the substitute the dependancy on 
\begin_inset Formula $Nd$

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{Cm}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lambda_{Cm}=\frac{Nd}{m}-\frac{\Delta\lambda_{m}}{2}=\frac{Nd}{m(m+1)}(m+0.5),\]

\end_inset

It is worth noting that althought 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{Cm}$
\end_inset

 is in the middle of the spectral range 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\lambda_{m}$
\end_inset

 the wavelenths are not linearly distributed along the angle range that
 it is diffracted to, and therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{Cm}$
\end_inset

 is not located at the center of the angle range of the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

th order free spectral range.
 [Graph]We see then that the free spectral range depends inverselly with
 the diffraction order used, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\Delta\lambda_{m}=\frac{\lambda_{Cm}}{m+0.5}.\label{eq:FSR}\end{equation}

\end_inset

This fact, ties to use the a maximum operating diffraction order to the

The previous exposition on diffraction grating does not change on the medium
 in which the device is built on.
 But since we are interested in spectrometeres integrated on chips, it worth
 lifting the characteristics of this device.
 From this point two features stand out as very different from regular free
 space spectrometer.
 First is that light is always guided in a slab waveguide, the confinement
 of light in one dimension change the nature of the system from a 3 dimensional
 to bi-dimensional one.
 As this fact causes the light power to decay with the inverse of the distance
 as it moves away from the source.
 The other diference is the change of the dispersion due to both the material
 and the confinement effect.
 The outcome of this is that for all the results in the previous section,
 the wavelength variable that needs to be considered is the effective wavelenght
 in the medium.

, the light to be analyzed is shined through the entrance slit.
 Due to diffraction, the light fan out as it propagates to the collimating
 concave mirror where light is collimated and reflected in the direction
 of the diffraction grating.
 The diffraction grating then, deviates light from each different wavelength
 (optical frequencies) into different angles following the equation

 A focusing concave mirror focus the light coming from the diffraction grating
 and deflect it to the detector slit.

The function of the entrance slit is to filter spatial optical modes that
 are inputed into the system.
 For best filtering the slit has to transmit only a single spatial mode.
 This is achieved by making the slit width of the order of the light wavelength.
 Decreasing slit width will increase the beam spread angle, as depicted
 in figure

\end_inset

, for a chosen final beam width this will allow the collimating concave
 mirror to placed nearer to the slit decreasing the device size.
 However, decrease the slit width will also decrease the fraction of transmitted
 light.

\begin_layout Standard
To quantify the amount of light deviated to each different direction, we
 use a focusing concave mirror, which will map light with different direction
 and focus them each into a distinct point in a plane.
 Alternatively we can say that light in different k in the k space into
 different points in the coordinate space.
 Clearly, the size of the focusing mirror must be such that it collects
 most of the light coming from the diffraction grating.
 This means that it must be bigger than the beam size plus account for the
 spread of different wavelengths.

A detector is placed at a point in the focus plan to measure the light power.
 Optimum detector size is of the order of the entrance slit width, limited

 as an alternative for the slit size detector.

By guiding light through waveguide it is possible to increase the difference
 of path length among different waveguides, achieved by only changing the
 waveguides lengths.
 Each waveguide of the waveguide array would function like a groove in the
 diffraction grating, but since waveguide length is only limited by its
 intrinsic loss, the difference of path length can be on the order of hundreds
 of wavelength, giving raise to grating that operate of diffraction order
 of also hundreds.

Unfortunately there is a drawback of increasing diffraction order, the free
 spectral range as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, decreases with the inverse of the of the diffraction order.
 For instance, an arrayed waveguide grating working on diffraction order
 100 at wavelength 1500 nm would have a FSR of only 15 nm.
 Although this range is useful for fiber optics telecommunications, this
 bandwidth is too small for most spectroscopy application, optical coherence
 tomography or ultra-fast oscilloscope[refs].
 Since we want to achieve a wide spectrum range, this architecture is not
 fit for us.

 In practice, this case not always occurs.
 Light source is normally a collimated light from a slit, pin hole or fiber
 optics, where for best resolution, single mode output should pass through.
 In those cases the tranversal power profile is better modeled by a gaussian
 than by a square profile, see figure

 To ajust the resolving power equation

 to account for the Gaussian profile illumination we have to alter the squared

 Using the relation we can equate 
\begin_inset Formula \[
U\left(p\right)=U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\int\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\delta\left(x-n\right)\text{rect}\left[\frac{x}{2\left(N-1\right)}\right]e^{-ikxdp}dx\]

\end_inset

the rect
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x\right)$

 function correspond to the squared illumination assumption, for a Gaussian
 illumination we simply replace tha function by a Gaussian function
\begin_inset Formula \[
\text{gauss}\mbox{\left(x\right)}=\exp\left[-4\ln2\left(\frac{x}{w/d}\right)^{2}\right]\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $d$

 is the Full Width at Half Maximum of the illuminating beam at the grating.
 Replacing the Dirac delta comb by its Fourier series 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}\delta\left(x-k\right)=\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}e^{i2\pi mx},\]

\end_inset

we get
\begin_inset Formula \[
U\left(p\right)=U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}\int\exp\left[-4\ln2\left(\frac{x}{w/d}\right)^{2}\right]e^{-i2\pi x\left(kdp/2\pi-m\right)}dx\]

\end_inset

performing the integral we obtain a comb of Gaussian 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
U\left(p\right)=U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\frac{w}{\sqrt{2}}\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}\exp\left[-\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{kdp}{2\pi}-m\right)^{2}\frac{\left(w/d\right)^{2}}{4\ln2}\right],\label{eq:gaussian comb}\end{equation}

Rowland Ghosts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rowland ghosts are spurious lines seen in some grating spectra that result
 from periodic errors in the spacing of the grooves.
 These are usually located symmetrically with respect to each strong spectral
 line at a spectral distance from it, which depends on the period of the
 error, and with an intensity that depends on the amplitude of this error.

Aberrations

\begin_layout Standard
The resolving power equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: resolving power"

\end_inset

 states that the resolution of a diffraction grating depends linearly with
 the wavelength.
 Unfortunatelly, that relation is only valid for plane waves.
 To use segregation capability of the diffraction grating, it is necessary
 to have a source of plane waves and to measure the light power that go
 to different direction after diffraction from the grating.
 Sources and detector are space localized endpoints.
 But employing lenses, it is possible to convert a space localized mode
 to a angle localized mode., as discussed on the Czerny-Turner configuration
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Czerny-Turner"

\end_inset

.
 This conversion, however, is not perfect.
 In geometrical optics terms, this means that rays that enter parallel in
 a lens (or any other focusin device) does no converge to a single point
 after the lens and with the fase arriving at exaclty the same time(picture?).
 Integrating the lens into the grating, as done in Rowland configuration
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, does not readily eliminate the problem, but its application together with
 the potencial to fabricate designs with freedom to choose any geometry
 and dispersion might be the solution.

The integration of silicon photonics and electronics in a CMOS compatible
 platform enables whole monolithic device such as a wavelength division
 demultiplexer (WDM) integrated with detectors and electronic amplifiers.
 Most silicon-on-insulator (SOI) WDMs with 1 nm channel spacing typically
 cover a spectral range of only 10 nm.
 The small spectral range in typical WDMs is due to the use of arrayed waveguide
 grating (AWG)[1,2] designs where large grating orders are employed to achieve
 small channel spacing which comes with the cost of free spectral range.
 It is possible to increase the spectral range by lowering the grating order
 and adding more waveguides to compensate, but this increases the overall
 chip size.
 Furthermore, due to the high index contrast of the silicon photonics platform,
 the achievable resolution depends on very fine control of the AWG waveguide
 dimensions.
 Here we demonstrate WDM using etched diffraction grating (EDG)[3-5].
 This design is more fabrication tolerant since light is propagating in
 a slab where the only dimension that needs to be controlled is the slab
 thickness.
 It is also more suitable to work at a low grating order because light diffracts
 in a single slab opposed to the two star couplers slabs in the AWG.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We designed a WDM that uses a Rowland design with one stigmatic point correction.
 The system was designed so that stigmatic point was located at the central
 waveguide of the 21 output waveguide array.
 The central wavelength was chosen to be 1500 nm and the diffraction order
 was 10.
 The Rowland circle was chosen to be 750 μm.
 The designed grating contains 340 grooves.
 The resulting free spectral range was estimated to be 117 nm, and the groove
 spacing approximately 4 μm.
 The input and output waveguide apertures were 1.4 μm.
 A reference waveguide was placed next to the spectrometer so that the transmiss
ion efficiency could be estimated.

 The pattern was transferred from PMMA the to the oxide layer using CHF3/O2
 reactive ion etch.
 The silicon layer was etched using Cl2 inductively coupled plasmaand then
 2.3 μm of SiO2 was deposited using PECVD to clad the device.

We measured the performance of our WDM and observed -10 dB crosstalk and
 1 nm channel spacing across 21 channels.
 As shown in Fig.
 2, a relatively flat transmission spectrum was obtained.
 This result was measured by inserting light from a tunable laser and measuring
 the power from the output waveguides.
 A fiber polarization controller was used to set the input polarization
 to TE and a polarizer was placed between the chip output and the detector
 to filter out any TM polarized light.
 An insertion loss of -10 dB was estimated by comparing to the transmission
 through the reference waveguide.
 This can be attributed to Fresnel reflection between the Si-SiO2 interfaces
 at the grating groove facet and can be reduced by coating the grating facets
 with a reflective metal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, we demonstrate a one point stigmatic Rowland grating WDM
 with 21 channels, 1 nm channel spacing and better than -10 dB crosstalk.
 Since the free spectral range is greater the 100 nm, by adding additional
 output waveguides it is possible to construct a WDM that covers whole C-band.

 figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 The resonator transmits only the resonant wavelengths.
 A diffraction grating spectrometer is then used to route light from different
 resonances into distinct output channels.
 The net effect is that the final resonator and diffraction grating spectrometer
 line width will be equal to the resonator line width.
 On silicon ring resonators cladded with silicon dioxide, line width as
 narrow as 30 pm are routinely achieved[ref].
 Therefore, enabling the possibility of creating 30 pm resolution spectrometers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To achieve this, the resonator and the spectrometer must be designed so
 that the channel spacing of the diffraction grating spectrometer matches
 the ring resonator FSR.
\end_layout

The spectrometer must be designed so that each output channel only allows
 to transmit a single resonance.

 The diffraction grating spectrometer contains 25 channels with spacing

 To match the ring resonator FSR to the DG spectrometer channel spacing
 we use an 83.5 m radius ring with waveguide cross-section of 450 x 250 nm.
 The FSR changes with wavelength according to

, but considering a slight positive group velocity dispersion (
\begin_inset Formula $\partial n_{g}/\partial\lambda\approx3.6\times10^{-3}\text{nm}^{-1}$

We measure the device transmission spectrum by coupling laser light from
 a tunable laser into the input waveguide using a lensed fiber and measuring
 the transmitted power as a function of wavelength.
 The input light is TE polarized and the output light is collected using
 a microscope objective and filtered for the TE polarization before detection.
 We achieve a channel FWHM of 0.05 nm across 10 different channels of the
 composed ring and EDG spectrometer, which represents a decrease in the
 channel width by 10 times compared with the DG spectrometer alone.
 This channel width corresponds to a quality factor of Q = 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda/\Delta\lambda$
\end_inset

= 30000.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 3(b) shows the device transmission.
 The transmission is normalized to the ring through port power level to
 eliminate coupling losses.
 The device insertion loss varies between -18 and -23 dB, where -10 dB is
 due to the Fresnel reflection of the diffraction grating and can be eliminated
 by coating it with a metal or using Bragg reflectors [9].
 Other losses are attributed to stitching in the waveguide definition during
 e-beam lithography.
 A small mismatch between the resonator FSR (0.97 nm) and the DG spectrometer
 channel spacing (1 nm) cause a misalignment between the resonance and the
 DG spectrometer channel that builds up from one channel to the next in
 a Vernier effect.
 The outcome is a misalignment between the 11th spectrometer channel and
 the 11th ring resonance.
 Therefore only 10 of the 25 channels on the DG spectrometer are used.
 This issue can be eliminated by more detailed characterization of fabrication.

Serializing devices either spatially or in time can increase the spectrometer
 channel density.
 The space serialization approach consists of using multiple combined ring-DG
 spectrometers, so that the input of a spectrometer is connected to the
 through port of the previous device, as shown in Fig.
 4(a).
 The peak wavelength of each spectrometer is shifted relative to the others.
 The number of devices needed in order to achieve the a spectral density
 where the channels are separated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\lambda_{FWHM}$
\end_inset

, is equal to the DG spectrometer channel width divided by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\lambda_{FWHM}$
\end_inset

.
 In spite of the area increase, this approach is still more compact than
 using a traditional diffraction grating spectrometer since in this proposed
 approach the area increases linearly with resolution as opposed to quadratic
 in traditional DGs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In time serialization, Fig.
 4(b), only a single combined spectrometer is used and the output spectrum
 is measured several times.
 In each measurement the device transmission spectrum is shifted.
 Notice that this approach also requires active tuning of the ring and the
 EDG spectrometer.
 By applying the time serialization technique we were able to reduce the
 channel spacing from 0.97 nm to 0.097 nm, and were able to measure 100 channels
 using the device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A zoom in on the series of channels is depicted in Fig.
 6 (a).
 Figure 6 (b) shows a density plot where each horizontal line corresponds
 to the transmission spectrum of each channel.
 Notice that the overlap of the residual transmission from the DG spectrometer
 with the neighboring resonances can be seen in the side diagonal lines,
 and their transmissions are at least 10 dB lower than the peak (main diagonal
 line).

If the aperture

 integral, which convert the integral to
