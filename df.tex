\section{Theory}

In OCT, the kind of interferometry used is the low-coherence type. In this section, we are going to describe how low-coherence interferometry is used to measure the distance of an object with more the one reflecting surface.


\subsection{Michelson Interferometer\label{sub:Michelson-Interferometer}}

%
\begin{figure}[h]
\center{\input{interferometer.pdf_tex}}
\caption{Michelson interferometer\label{fig:Michelson-interferometer}}
\end{figure}


Consider the interferometer shown in figure \ref{fig:Michelson-interferometer}. To simplify the analisys, ignore the light polarization and dispersion effects. A light source emits a radiation whose electric field shine upon a beamspliter e described by $E_{0}\left(t\right)$. This light is devided and a fraction $D$ of its power is directed to mirror $S$ with reflectivity $R_{s}$. The light is reflected and returns to the beam spliter, where a fraction $\left(1-D\right)$ of its power goes to the detector. Similarly, in the other interferometer arm, $\left(1-D\right)$ of the light emited by the light source is redirected to the mirror $R_{r}$, which is reflected and returns to the beamspliter, where a fraction $D$ of this light is redirected back to the detector. The electric field at the detector can be decribed by

\begin{equation}
E_{s}=\sqrt{K_{0}}E_{0}\left(t-\tau_{a}\right)+\sqrt{K_{r}}E_{0}\left(t-\tau_{r}\right),\label{eq:Simplest Field equation}
\end{equation}

where $K_{i}=R_{i}D\left(1-D\right)$ is the light power fraction that is shined to the detector and $\tau_{i}$ is the time the light takes to go from the beamspliter to the mirror $i$ and back.

The relationship between the output light intensity $\left\langle I\right\rangle $ and the mean electric field is:

\begin{equation}
\left\langle I\right\rangle =\left\langle \frac{\left|E\left(t\right)\right|^{2}}{2\eta_{0}}\right\rangle ,\label{eq:intensity field relation}
\end{equation}

where $\eta_{0}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu_{0}}{\varepsilon_{0}}}$ is the free space impedance. Using \ref{eq:Simplest Field equation} and \ref{eq:intensity field relation}, we get the intensity at the detector as been

\begin{equation}
\left\langle I\right\rangle =\left\langle I_{\text{DC}}\right\rangle +\sqrt{K_{s}K_{r}}\Re\left(\Gamma\left(\tau_{s,a}\right)\right)\label{eq:michelson output intensity equation}
\end{equation}

where $\tau_{r,s}=\tau_{s}-\tau_{r}$. We define the autocorrelation function for beam electric field as

\[ \Gamma\left(\tau\right)=\frac{E\left(t-\tau\right)E^{*}\left(t\right)}{\eta_{0}}\]

andi

\[
\left\langle I_{\text{DC}}\right\rangle =\sum_{j}K_{j}\left\langle I_{0}\right\rangle ,\]

where $\left\langle I_{0}\right\rangle =\left\langle \frac{\left|E_{0}\left(t\right)\right|^{2}}{2\eta_{0}}\right\rangle $ is the mean light intensity that leaves the source, which in this case is constant. More specifically, it is of interest that the light source should be stationary in the wide sense, which means

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\left\langle E\left(t\right)\right\rangle $ is independent of $t$.
\item $\left\langle E\left(t_{1}\right)E^{*}\left(t_{2}\right)\right\rangle $
depends only on $\tau=t_{2}-t_{1}$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Optical interferometry with coherent light}

%
\begin{figure}[h]
\input{interferometerGraphics.pdf_tex}\caption{Light intensity at the interferometer output for input source of (a)
coherent light. (b) light with coherence length $\Delta l_{c}$.\label{fig:interferometerGraphics}}

\end{figure}


If the light is perfectly coherent (i.e. monochromatic), then its electric field can be described as $E\left(t\right)=E_{0}e^{-i2\pi\nu t}$ where $\nu$ is the optical frequency and $E_{0}$ is the field amplitude. Replacing $E\left(t\right)=E_{0}e^{-i2\pi\nu t}$ in equation and using, we get

\begin{equation}
\left\langle I\right\rangle =\left\langle I_{\text{DC}}\right\rangle +2\left\langle I_{0}\right\rangle \sqrt{K_{s}K_{r}}\cos\left(2\pi\nu\tau_{s,r}\right),\label{eq:interference coherent delay}\end{equation}

or, using $\lambda=c/\nu$ and $\Delta l=\frac{c}{2}\left(\tau_{s}-\tau_{r}\right)$

\begin{equation}
\left\langle I\right\rangle =\left\langle I_{\text{SD}}\right\rangle +2\left\langle I_{0}\right\rangle \sqrt{K_{s}K_{r}}\cos\left(2\pi\frac{\Delta l}{\lambda/2}\right).\label{eq:interference coherent length}\end{equation}


Equation says that the light intensity in the detector varies peridicaly with the interferometer arm length difference $\Delta l$, with period $\lambda/2$. In special, in case $K_{s}=K_{r}$ we get points of zero intensity, as illustrated in \ref{fig:interferometerGraphics}(a).


\subsection{Low-coherence interferometry}

In practice, the coherence of a light source is always limited. In a real case, overlaped with the rapid intensity oscilation with period $\lambda/2$, we will notice a gradual decrease of oscilation amplitude.  The full width a half maximum of the oscilation envelope is called \emph{coherence length\index{coherence length}} $\Delta l_{c}$.  Which we are going to show that is inversly proportional to the light source bandwidth.

Consider the interferometer in figure \ref{fig:Michelson-interferometer}, now iluminated with a low coherence light, whose spectrum lineshape is described by $G\left(\nu\right)$. The mean light intensity in the detector can be described by the equation \ref{eq:michelson output intensity equation}. Acording with the \fnurl{Wiener-Khinchin theorem}{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener\%E2\%80\%93Khinchin_theorem}, the autocorrelation of the signal and its power density spectrum are related by a fourier transform

\begin{equation}
G\left(\nu\right)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\Gamma\left(\tau\right)e^{i2\pi\nu\tau}d\tau\label{eq:spectrum from auto correlation}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\Gamma\left(\tau\right)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}G\left(\nu\right)e^{-i2\pi\nu\tau}d\nu\label{eq:autocorrelation from spectrum}\end{equation}


If the light source power spectrum is lineshape is gaussian

\begin{equation} G\left(\nu\right)=\frac{\left\langle I_{0}\right\rangle }{\Delta\nu}\sqrt{\frac{4\ln2}{\pi}}e^{-4\ln2\left(\frac{\nu-\nu_{0}}{\Delta\nu}\right)^{2}},\label{eq:gaussian spectrum}\end{equation}

where $\nu_{0}$ is the central optical frequency, $\Delta\nu$ is the FWHM of the gaussian. The auto correlation of this spectrum is

\begin{equation}
\Gamma\left(\tau\right)=\left\langle I_{0}\right\rangle e^{-i2\pi\nu_{0}\tau}e^{-\ln2\tau^{2}/\Delta\tau_{c}^{2}}\label{eq:gaussian autocorrelation function}\end{equation}

where $\Delta\tau_{c}=\frac{2\ln2}{\pi\Delta\nu}$ is called the \emph{coherence time}, or alternatively using $\tau=\frac{2\Delta l}{c}$

\begin{equation}
\Gamma\left(\Delta l\right)=\left\langle I_{0}\right\rangle e^{-i2\pi\frac{\Delta l}{\lambda_{0}/2}}e^{-\ln2\frac{\Delta l^{2}}{\left(\Delta l_{c}/2\right)^{2}}}\label{eq:gaussian autocorrelation function by distance}\end{equation}

where $\Delta l_{c}=\frac{2\ln2c}{\pi\Delta\nu}=\frac{2\ln2\lambda_{0}^{2}}{\pi\Delta\lambda}$ is defined as \emph{coherence length}. $\lambda_{0}$ the central wavelength. Replacing \ref{eq:gaussian autocorrelation function by distance} on \ref{eq:michelson output intensity equation} we get

\begin{equation} \left\langle I\right\rangle =\left\langle I_{\text{SD}}\right\rangle +2\left\langle I_{0}\right\rangle \sqrt{K_{s}K_{r}}\cos\left(2\pi\frac{\Delta l}{\lambda_{0}/2}\right)e^{-i2\pi\frac{\Delta l}{\lambda_{0}/2}}e^{-\ln2\frac{\Delta l^{2}}{\left(\Delta l_{c}/2\right)^{2}}}\label{eq:gaussianInterferogram}\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:gaussianInterferogram} justifies the behavior of the light intensity at the interometer output described in the begining of section and ilustrated in \ref{fig:interferometerGraphics} (b). The cossine is resposible for the rapid osciliation and the gaussian modulates the oscilation amplitude, which fall to half at a distance $\Delta l_{c}/2$. As said before, the coherence length is inversly proportional to the light spectrum. The specific power spectrum lineshape of the alters the autocorrelation function, but the coherence length decreasing with the increase of the power spectrum width of the light source is not altered.

\subsection{Low coherence interferometry with multilayer structures}

%
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.48\columnwidth}%
\input{interferometerSample.pdf_tex}\caption{Inteferometer with low coherence light source and microstructured
sample. \label{fig:interferometer}}

\end{minipage}\hfill{}%
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.48\columnwidth}%
\input{interferogram-TD.pdf_tex}\caption{Intensity at detector as the reference arm is scanned.\label{fig:interferometer2}}
%
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}


To describe the reconstruction fot he transversal image of a structure, we replace the $s$ mirror by a sample with dilectric layers. The input beam is focused onto the sample surface, as show in figure .  We can model the light electric field at \ref{fig:interferometer} the interferometer output a coming from the sample arm as

\[
E_{s}\left(t\right)=\sum_{i}K_{i}E_{0}\left(t-\tau_{i}\right),\]

where $E_{0}\left(t\right)$ is the light source field and $K_{i}=R_{i}\left(1-D\right)D$, $D$ being the beamspliter splitting ratio, $R_{i}$ is the reflectivity of the $i$-th sample interface and $\tau_{i}$ is the roundtrip time from the beamsplitter to the $i$-th sample interface. The intensity at the detector will then be

\[
\left\langle I\right\rangle =\left\langle \frac{\left|E_{s}\left(t\right)+E_{r}\left(t\right)\right|^{2}}{2\eta_{0}}\right\rangle =\left\langle I\right\rangle +\sum_{i}\sqrt{K_{i}K_{r}}\Re\left[\Gamma\left(\tau_{r,i}\right)\right]\]

where $E_{r}\left(t\right)=K_{r}E\left(t-\tau_{r}\right)$ is the light electric field that comes from the reference mirror and $\tau_{r}=2\Delta l/c$. For a sample show in figure, the intensity as a function of the delay $\tau_{r}$ will be as show in the the black graph in figure \ref{fig:interferometer2}, what we call \emph{interferogram}. In it, we can identify three packets, each corresponding to a light returning from each of the sample interfaces.
The interval time between packages is equal to the time light take to go from on interface to the other and return, $\tau_{x}=n_{g}\Delta l_{x}/c$, where $n_{g}$ is the group index of the material the light is propagating at.

Light is then detected and pass through a envelope detector circuit. This circuit eliminates the oscilition within the packets, leaving the envelope of the signal, as shown in red on the graph \ref{fig:interferometer2}, to which we call \emph{tomogram}. A image is made by translating a the beam transversaly to the beam direction a taking a tomogram after a chosen step size.


\subsection{Detector signal}

The mean current generated by the photodiode can be described as

\[
\left\langle i\right\rangle =\frac{e\eta}{\eta\nu_{0}}\left\langle P\right\rangle ,\]

where $\left\langle P\right\rangle =A\left\langle I\right\rangle $ is the mean light power that hits the detector in the area $A$, $\eta$ is the detector quantum eficiency, $e$ is the electron charge and $h$ is the Planck constant. If we scan the reference mirror at a velocity $u_{r}$ in the low coherence interometer described previously, the current will be

\[
\left\langle i\right\rangle =\frac{e\eta}{\eta\nu_{0}}\left[\left\langle P_{\text{DC}}\right\rangle +2\left\langle P_{0}\right\rangle \sqrt{K_{s}K_{r}}\cos\left(2\pi\nu_{r}t\right)e^{-i2\pi\frac{\Delta l}{\lambda_{0}/2}}e^{-\ln2\frac{u_{r}^{2}t^{2}}{\left(\Delta l_{c}/2\right)^{2}}}\right],\]

where $\nu_{r}=\frac{u_{r}}{\lambda_{0}/2}$. To remove some noise in the detector current, the signal is filtered using an electronic pass band filter centered at $\nu_{r}$ with bandwidth $B$,

\[
B\approx\frac{u_{r}\Delta\nu}{c}\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\ln2}}\]




which removes the DC current due to the term $\left\langle P_{DC}\right\rangle $. 

The electric peak current of the interference pattern at $\Delta l=0$ is

\begin{equation}
\left\langle i\right\rangle =\frac{2e\eta}{h\nu_{0}}\left\langle P_{0}\right\rangle \sqrt{K_{r}K_{s}}.\label{eq:current intensity relation}\end{equation}


Equation \ref{eq:current intensity relation} shows that the electric current is proportional to the square root of the light power fraction that returns form the sample $K_{s}$ and the reference mirro $K_{s}$, which show a heterodyne amplification of the signal coming from the sample.


\section{Reflectivity Sensitivity}

In a OCT system it is of interest to know what is the smallest interface reflectivity that can be observed. The quantity is refereced as \emph{reflectivity sensitiviy} or more simply \emph{sensitivity}.


\subsection{Effective reflectivity vs interface reflectivity}


\subsection{Signal to noise ratio}

The signal to noise ratio (SNR) is a physical quantity of $i$ defined as

\[
\text{SNR}=\frac{\left\langle i\right\rangle ^{2}}{\sigma_{i}},\]

where $\left\langle i\right\rangle $ and $\sigma_{i}^{2}$ are, respectively, the mean and the variance of the current $i$. Physically, the definition tell how great is the information $\left\langle i\right\rangle $ compared to the mean fluctuations amplitude $\sigma_{i}$ due to noise. 


\subsection{Noise sources}

The noise shown here in the detection band used can be considered white noise with zero mean and non correlated. The outcome of that is that the variance of the noise signals sum is equal to the sum of the variance of each noise signal.

\[ \sigma_{i}=\sum_{n}\sigma_{n}^{2}\]



\subsubsection{Shot noise}

Noise due to the quantization of light and electric current. The quantity of photons arriving at the detector in a sampling interval $\Delta t$ is not constant, even if the power of the light source is. The distribuition of the number of photons hitting the detector as a poissonian lineshape, whose width is equal to the mean number of photons. In addition to that, the photoelectron generation ocurs with a probability $\eta$, defined as quantum efficiency. It can be shown, that the photoelectron current has a variance

\[
\sigma_{s}^{2}=e\left\langle i\right\rangle B,\]

where $e$ is the electron charge and $B$ is the detection bandwith of the circuit.


\subsubsection{Relative intensity noise}

Relative intensity noise (RIN) are noise that grows linearly with the mean photo-current power. A few examples include the optical source power fluctuations. The noise spectral density can be model with a white noise over the band of interest. Therefore, the variance of this noise can be described as

\[
\sigma_{RIN}^{2}=e\gamma\left\langle i\right\rangle ^{2}B,\]

where the parameter $\gamma$ is experimentally measured. In practice it is possible to remove this noise using a balanced detection system. We therefore will not take this noise into consideration in the final calculation.


\subsubsection{Thermal noise}

There are two main forms of thermal noise. One during detection, when black body radiation and thermal phonons in the detector causes the excitation of electrons generating a current with mean $\left\langle i\right\rangle =e\beta k\theta$ and variance

\[
\sigma_{\theta1}^{2}=e\beta k\theta B,\]

where $\beta$ is a detector geometry and material constant, $\theta$ is the temperature and $k$ is the Boltzmann constant. Since its value is of the order of $3\times10^{-15}$ A in room temperature, we will not take it into account.

Also called Johnson-Nyquist noise is the electronic noise generated by the thermal agitation of the charge carriers (usually the electrons) inside an electrical conductor at equilibrium, which happens regardless of any applied voltage. It is a zero mean noise with variance equal

\[
\sigma_{\theta2}^{2}=4k\theta RB,\]

where $R$ is the conductor resistance.


\subsection{Sensitivity optimization}


\chapter{Fourier Domain OCT}

In 1995, Fercher et al described a way to determine the strucre 

Em 1995, Fercher et al. \footcite{Fercher:1995p1683} descreveram uma
forma de determinar a estrutura de um objeto a partir da informação
do espectro da luz retroespalhada. Essa foi a primeira demonstração
do conceito de tomografia por coerência óptica no domínio de Fourier.
Em 2002, Wojtkowski et al. \footcite{Wojtkowski:2002p1704,Wojtkowski:2002p3}
demonstraram a capacidade de obter imagens da retina humana usando
uma TCO no domínio Fourier, derrubando o ceticismo corrente em relação
à funcionalidade da técnica. Estudos posteriores{[}17{]} demonstraram
a superioridade da TCO no domínio de Fourier em relação à TCO temporal
com relação à sensibilidade, desviando o foco de diversos grupos de
que trabalham com TCO para esta modalidade em particular.


\section{Overview of fourier domain OCT}

%
\begin{figure}[h]
	\center{\input{interferometer.pdf_tex}}
	\caption{Michelson interferometer\label{fig:Michelson-interferometer-2}}
\end{figure}


Before showing more rigorous derivation of we will show a more intuitive picturo on how frequency domain OCT reconstruct it image. Let a Michelson interferometer ilustrated on \ref{fig:Michelson-interferometer-2} and described in section \ref{sub:Michelson-Interferometer}. It was show in section \ref{sub:Michelson-Interferometer} that the light intensity in the interferometer output is described by

\[ \left\langle I\right\rangle =\left\langle I_{0}\right\rangle +\frac{\sqrt{K_{r}K_{s}}}{\eta_{0}}\cos\left(2\pi\nu\tau_{r,s}\right).\]

Notice that the equation has a dual behavior relative to optical frequency $\nu$ and the time delay $\tau$. Usually, it is easiear to vary the interferometer arm length keeping the optical frequency (or wavelength) constant and observe the light intensity at the interferometer output. We will then see interference fringes as graph on figure \ref{fig:freqGraphSimple}. But if we keep the arms length diference constant and equal $\Delta l=c\tau/2$, we can rewrite equation \ref{eq:interference coherent length} as

\[
\left\langle I\right\rangle =\left\langle I_{0}\right\rangle +\frac{\sqrt{K_{r}K_{s}}}{\eta_{0}}\cos\left(2\pi\frac{2\Delta l}{c}\nu\right).\]


Notice that the oscilation period in inversly proportional to $\Delta l$. Therefore, if we know the period of the intensity oscilation in optical frequency $\Delta\nu$, the we can calculate the diference of optical pathlength between the interferometer arms, $\Delta l=\frac{c}{2\Delta\nu}$.
  
If instead of a mirror we put dielectric sample in place of a sample mirror, as show in figure \ref{fig:InterferometerBiLayer}, instead of getting a simple intensity oscilation, we will get a superposition of several senoids described by the equation below

\[
\left\langle I\right\rangle =\left\langle I_{0}\right\rangle \left[1+F_{r,1}\cos\left(2\pi\tau_{r,1}\nu\right)+F_{r,2}\cos\left(2\pi\tau_{r,2}\nu\right)+F_{1,2}\cos\left(2\pi\tau_{1,2}\nu\right)\right].\]

The second and the second term in the braces are related to the interference between the light from the reference mirror and the interfaces 1 and 2. The fourth term is due to the interference of the interfaces 1 and 2 between themselves. As can be seen by figure \ref{fig:graphics interference bi-layer}, it is difficult to identify the frequencies of each harmonic associated with the interference of light coming from two interfaces. However, we can identify the contribution of each harmonic by taking the fourier transform of the power spectrum as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:ft graph interferometer bi-layer}.

The presence peak due to the interference between the two interfaces of the sample are called \emph{self-interference}, and as can be seen, it creates reconstruction artifacts that obstruct the reconstructed image. However, note that the distance of the peak is equal to the sample thickness, and is independent of the distance between the interfaces and the reference distance. Therfore, if the distance of the sample surface to the reference is greater than the sample thickness, all peaks after the position $\Delta l_{1,2}$ are free of the these artifacts. In the following section we will show other methods to supress these artifacts.

In princple Fourier transform assumes the integration for in a infinite spectral range. In practice this is not possible, this limitation causes the decrease of the precision with which the oscilation frequencies are estimated and therefore decreasing the resolution to which we can observe the interace.

In the show example, the output spectrum in measured by varying the light source wavelength. This type of operation is called swept source.  However, it is possible to use a light source with broad spectrum, and distiguish the contribution of each optical frequency using a spectrometer principe using in the spectral radar OCT.


\section{Frequency domain OCT}

Considere o esquema da figura 3.6. Uma fonte de luz de baixa coerência emite uma radiação, cujo campo elétrico na saída da fonte é descrito por E (t). A luz é dividida no acoplador de fibra óptica, onde uma fração D da potência é direcionada para o espelho de referência com refletividade Rr. A luz então retorna ao acoplador onde (1\textminus{}D), e vai para o espectrômetro. Analogamente, no braço da amostra, (1 \textminus{} D) da luz emitida pela fonte incidem sobre a amostra, onde uma fração Ri que foi retro-refletida ou retro-espalhada na camada i retorna à fibra e uma porção D dessa se encaminha para o espectrômetro. O campo elétrico na entrada do espectrômetro é descrito por

\[
E\left(t\right)=\sqrt{K_{r}}E_{0}\left(t-\tau\right)+\sum_{i}\sqrt{K_{i}}E_{0}\left(t-\tau_{i}\right)\]


onde K j = R j D (1 \textminus{} D) é a fração da potência da fonte que chega na entrada do espectrômetro e \textgreek{t} j é o tempo necessário para luz percorrer o caminho da saída da fonte até a interface j e em seguida para o espectrômetro.

The autocorrelation function of the output light electric field $\Gamma\left(\tau\right)=\left\langle E\left(t\right)E^{*}\left(t-\tau\right)\right\rangle $

\begin{equation}
\Gamma\left(\tau\right)=\left[K_{r}+\sum_{i}K_{i}\right]\Gamma_{0}\left(\tau\right)+\sum_{i}K_{r,i}\Gamma_{0}\left(\tau+\Delta\tau_{r,i}\right)+\sum_{i}K_{r,i}\Gamma_{0}\left(\tau-\Delta\tau_{r,i}\right)+\sum_{i\ne j}K_{i,j}\Gamma_{0}\left(\tau-\Delta\tau_{i,j}\right),\label{eq:FDautocorrelation}\end{equation}

where $K_{a,b}=\sqrt{K_{a}K_{b}}$, $\Delta\tau_{a,b}=\tau_{a}-\tau_{b}=\frac{2\Delta l_{a,b}}{c}$ and $\Gamma_{0}\left(\tau\right)=\left\langle E_{0}\left(t\right)E_{0}^{*}\left(t-\tau\right)\right\rangle $.

Before describing $\Gamma$, is worth recall that $\Gamma_{0}$ is complex function and therefore so is $\Gamma$. However, we are interested on the $\left|\Gamma\right|$. In section we discussed the types of $\left|\Gamma_{0}\right|$ and how they are related to the light source power spectral density, for this section it is just worth remembering that it is a peak function centered at argument.

The first term of the equation \ref{eq:FDautocorrelation} will give raise to a peak centered at the origin, called the DC term. The second term are constituted of several peaks each centered at its respective delays $\Delta\tau_{r,i}$ and height proportional to its reflectance. This is the information which we are going to use in the image reconstruction.
The third them as repeated information of the second term but inverted relative to the origin, called \emph{mirror image}. The fourht term are self interferences, due to the interference of backscattered light in the sample only.

The principle of FD OCT is based on calculating the auto-correlation function of the output light from its power spectrum density. Acording to the Wiener-Khinchin theorem the auto-correlation of a function and its power spectral density are related by a Fourier Transform.  Therefore the, power spectral density at the interferometer output is

\[
G\left(\nu\right)=G_{0}\left(\nu\right)\left[\left(K_{r}+\sum_{i}K_{i}\right)+2\sum_{i}K_{r,i}\cos\left(2\pi\nu\Delta\tau_{r,i}\right)+2\sum_{i\ne j}K_{i,j}\cos\left(2\pi\nu\Delta\tau_{i,j}\right)\right],\]

where $G_{0}$ is the light source PSD. We see that the interferometer output PSD is composed of interference fringes whose frequencies grows with the delays $\Delta\tau_{a,b}$, and is modulated by a envelope equal toe the input light PSD.


\subsection{FD OCT image reconstruction}

The modulus of the auto-correlation of the inteferometer output light can be calculated from the output PSD. But as stated before we are only interested in the second term of the auto-correlation function.

\[ \left|\Gamma_{2}\right|=\sum_{i}K_{r,i}\left|\Gamma_{0}\left(\tau+\Delta\tau_{r,i}\right)\right|,\]

Several methods were developed to extract the this term from the auto-correlation function. Each method having it own virtues and shortcomings in terms of processing power, additional equipment, sensitivity to sample motion (relevant for in vivo imaging). We describe a selection of the methods below.


\subsubsection{DC level removal}

This method removes the DC peak of the reconstructed image. The basic principle relies on filtering out any component that does no change as the beam is transversally scanning the sample. This will include besides the DC term, also any back reflection in the fiber optics ends.

languages, including C, Labview, Python, Matlab.

\subsection{Spectral resolution effects}

Aquisition of a spectrum implies that there is a minimum spectral resolution. The consequence of this constraint is that it limits the mininum interference fringe period that can be measured, and therefore, the observable range. Full analysis make use of \fnurl{Shannon sampling theorem}{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist\%E2\%80\%93Shannon_sampling_theorem}.

\[
g\left(\nu_{i}\right)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}G\left(\nu\right)R\left(\nu-\nu_{i}\right)d\nu\]


The measurement range of the FDOCT device depends on the spectral resolution of the spectrometer. Practically the useful information about the object structure is deciphered by the numerical Fourier transform FFT of the measured signal. The number of sampling points N is given by the number of illuminated CCD pixels. The dependence between the jth harmonic and the optical path difference j is the following 

\[
l_{j}=\frac{1}{2n}\frac{\lambda_{0}^{2}}{\Delta\lambda}j,\, j=1,2,\ldots,N/2\]


where n is the refractive index and is the registered width of the spectrum. According to the Nyquist condition the index of the maximum harmonics is equal to N/2. Therefore the maximum path difference registered by a FDOCT device is

\[
l_{\text{max}}=\frac{1}{4\pi}\frac{\lambda_{0}^{2}}{\Delta\lambda}N.\]



\section{Processing}

Displacement guessing algorithm

\includegraphics{/Users/bernardo/Dropbox/thesis/pasted4}

Knowing spectra G(i)(m), and corresponding phase shifts Di(m), i = 0,1,...,N, N P 3 one may determine I0, a1 and a2 for each m using the least squares method {[}11{]}. Then, the complex function U(m) can be immediately reconstructed via the parameters a1 and a2

\includegraphics{/Users/bernardo/Dropbox/thesis/pasted5}

When the inverse Fourier transformation is applied to the complex function U(m) an axial profile (optical A-scan) free of both autocorrelation and overlapping mirror images is obtained
 
\includegraphics{/Users/bernardo/Dropbox/thesis/pasted6}

Here, C(s) = FT1(S(m)) is the coherence function and denotes convolution. The phase shift Di in Eq. (2) is introduced by the displacement of a mirror in the reference arm by multiple of dz, which is assumed to be precisely known. Movements of the object (during in vivo studies) cause additional (unknown), displacements dz0i. Thus, the total phase shifts D may be expressed as follows:

\includegraphics{/Users/bernardo/Dropbox/thesis/pasted7}

It must be noted that the polychromatic phase error has been already avoided by taking into account the relationship between the phase and optical path-length shifts. The first approximation of phase shifts Di(m) may be calculated from known mirror displacement dz (5) with dz0i 1\textfractionsolidus{}4 0. These phases are introduced into Eq. (2), and \textquoteleft{}\textquoteleft{}unwrapped\textquoteright{}\textquoteright{} image is reconstructed via Eqs. (3) and (4). If the object is immobile, the tomogram is free of mirror images but for in vivo measurements the ghosts usually appear. To remove them completely, the values of dz0i must be taken into account. To do so, for every A-scan, the displacements dz0i ; i 1\textfractionsolidus{}4 1; 2; 3 has been adjusted to minimize the function

\includegraphics{/Users/bernardo/Dropbox/thesis/pasted8}\footcite{Targowski:2005p1741}

where Vk is the intensity in kth point of A-scan obtained with complex method, VK k is the intensity at its mirror image, and the function R represents the level of correlation between the A-scan (Vk) and its mirror image (VK k). The procedure is performed in two steps.  The first step takes into account possible effect of steady motion of the object. In this case optical delays for subsequent measurements are still equal but their magnitudes differ from that caused solely by the mirror displacement. Therefore for every Ascan the new value of ðoz i þ dz0iÞ \textendash{} including both the mirror and object displacements, is estimated in one-dimensional Golden Section Search {[}13{]} for the minimum of the function R. The range where the parameters are sought is 0\textendash{}kmin/6 to prevent the situations when the total phase shift D3 reaches 2p or goes beyond that limit. In the second step dz01 and dz02 are fine adjusted in two-dimensional conjugate gradient minimalization of function R utilizing the Fletcher\textendash{}Reeves algorithm {[}14{]} with dz03 fixed at the value found in the previ- ous stage. Due to the symmetry of function R, the retrieved A-scan may belong to either left or right image. The choice of initial phases for iteration favours one of them. Rare, inverted A-scans are automatically recognized by correlation with neighbouring A-scans and reversed.

\chapter{Signal Processing}

Volumetric and video rate optical coherence tomography generate large amount of data that needs to be processed before presented. Video rate imaging requires that the whole a whole image to be processed the frame rate, which is not a trivial task.

Considering that the each line consists of $N_p$ points (typically in the range of 500 to 2000) and each image has $N_{l}$ lines (500 to 5000). Images are generated at a frame rate of $F$(Movies rate being 25Hz but as slow as 10 Hz are acceptable). The total number of points that needs to be processed per second $P$ is $P=N_{p}N_{l}F$.  Which, using the numbers given before would be in the range $2.5\times10^{6}$ e $2.5\times10^{8}$ points per second.

A concern is that part of the processing is a discreet Fourier transform which the fastest algorithm available (fast fourier transform) is does the processing in order $O\mbox{\ensuremath{\left(n\log\mbox{n}\right)}}$, where $n$ is the number of points in the array the discreet fourier transform is being perfomed at.


\chapter{Applications}

Most of the time the OCT systems were stable and easy to use that no physical assistance from my person was needed.

\section{\emph{In vitro} imaging of remaining dentin and pulp chamber by optical coherence tomography: comparison between 850 and 1280 nm}

The success of the dental treatment, particularly restoration, depends on the integral knowledge of the properties, structure, and function of the complex to dentin-pulpar, which constitutes the necessary biological basis for making clinical decisions. Despite the differences in structure and composition, pulp and dentin are integrally connected in the sense that physiologic and pathologic reactions in one of the tissues will also affect the other. The two tissues have a common embryonic origin and also remain in an intimate relationship throughout the life of the vital tooth. Anything that affects dentin will affect the pulp and vice versa\footcite{Mjor:2002p2276}.

Many factors are involved in the pulpal response, such as citotoxicity of the dental material, the application method of the restorative material, and the presence of bacteria.  However, it seems that the effects of a restorative preparation, patient age, and remaining dentin thickness between cavity floor and pulp tissue play an important role in the intensity of pulpal response and stimulation of tertiary dentin deposition\footcite{Murray:2000p2283}.

In addition, during excavation procedures and cavity and crown preparation, the pulp may be accidentally exposed. Knowledge of the configuration of the pulpal space and the pulp-dentin complex morphology plays an important role to prevent iatrogenic or so-called accidental exposure of the pulp. It is often difficult in clinical practice and with conventional image techniques, such as X-ray, to identify the exact dimensions of the internal tooth anatomy\footcite{Mjor:2002p2276}.

To detect the depth of the dental cavity in relation to the pulpar chamber, the professionals withhold information collected through the clinical examination\textemdash visual and tactile inspection\textemdash and of the radiographic examination. These methods are subjective, which may lead to the wrong choice for the ideal treatment. Moreover, the radiographic procedure possesses some limitations for presenting overlapping of anatomical structures, for being a static method and emitting ionizing radiation.

The optical coherence tomography OCT consists of a new imaging technique for diagnosis that produces bior three-dimensional pictures, with a few microns of spatial resolution, and has been widely used to study biotissues, as reviewed\footcite{Bouma:2002p2007}. This technique was initially used in ophthalmology\footcite{Huang:1991p1955}, where it is well developed and clinically used, but it has been continuously benefiting other areas, such as cardiology\footcite{Boppart:1997p1840}, gastroenterology\footcite{Tearney:1996p2052}, dermatology\footcite{Pierce:2004p1839}, and cellular engineering\footcite{Yang:2006p2053}. In dentistry, the first applications were reported in 1998\footcite{ColstonJr:1998p1677}, having been used for diverse purposes such as characterization of periodontal structures\footcite{Otis:2000p2284,ColstonJr:1995p1719}, recurrent caries's detection of and marginal adaptation of restorations\footcite{DeMelo:2005p2100}, and precocious detention of oral cancer\footcite{Jung:2005p2056}. 

More recently, besides evaluation of enamel interface restoration\footcite{DeMelo:2005p2100}, also early caries diagnostics\footcite{Freitas:2009p2142} and the analysis of the performance of the dental materials\footcite{Kyotoku:2010p788,Braz:2009p2143} have been studied and reported by our group. In 2006, Kauffman et al. performed the first OCT image of dental pulps using rat's teeth\footcite{Kauffman:2006p2144}.

The key elements of an OCT setup include a broadband light source, whose spectral width limits the axial spatial resolution; an interferometer, which generally employs a Michelson design containing in one of the arms the sample and in the other arm a delay line; and an optical detector, whose signal output is electronically treated and fed to a computer for the image generation. Two domains can be exploited for implementation of an OCT system: the time domain or the spectral domain. In the time domain, the optical delay line arm basically consists of either a movable arm or a Fourier domain delay line\footcite{Cense:2004p2285}. In the spectral domain, there are no movable parts in the interferometer arms except for lateral displacement of the beam on the sample, and the recombined beams from the interferometer are sent to a spectrometer and are Fourier analyzed. It has been shown that spectral domain OCT SD-OCT has several advantages over the time domain OCT, including sensitivity\footnote{Wojtkowski:2002p3} and fast acquisition data, and because the first report on imaging implementation using SD-OCT\footnote{Wojtkowski:2002p3} it has been widespread. 

This work reports the first research comparing images obtained by OCT of the complex dentin-pulp of in vitro human teeth, using two different wavelengths in the near infrared, and also using a conical beam tomography as the gold standard. The results are compared, and the conclusion that OCT at 1280 nm performs better than at 850 nm is obtained, besides corroborating the feasibility of OCT for potential clinical use to prevent accidental exposure of the pulp and to promote preventive restoration treatment.


\section{Materials and Methods}

The experimental study was carried out in accordance with the ethical guidelines in research with human participants by Center of Health Sciences, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Brazil. 

Higid molar teeth from humans were used in this research. The occlusal surfaces of the teeth were prepared with a perpendicular carbide bur along the axis of the teeth producing a plane on that surface, which were subsequently polished manually with wet 400 m, 600-, and 1200- water sandpaper sheet with irrigation. Wear was performed perpendicular to the long axis of teeth and lasted until the occurence of minimal cavity pulpal exposure creating a plane on occlusal surface. The wear stopped until the occurrence of minimal cavity pulpal exposure. In practice, polishing or surface preparation is not required to obtain the images. 

To perform OCT imaging of teeth, we used two home-built OCT systems, whose schematic diagrams are shown in Fig. 1. Figure 1a shows the schematic of the SD-OCT system operating at the wavelength of 850 nm. The broadband source is a superluminescent diode Broadband SLD Lightsource S840, SUPERLUM, Moscow, Russia delivering up to 25 mW and with a 49.9-nm bandwidth, which gives an axial resolution of 6 m. After traveling through the all-fiber beamsplitter, the reflected beams from the sample and mirror are recombined and sent through a purpose-designed spectrometer consisting of a lens collimator system, 1200-L/mm grating, and CCD ATMEL, 2048 pixels, 12 bits, California.  The maximum incident power on the sample was 5 mW. The output is sent to a personal computer with a LabView-based imaging program. 

Figure 1b shows the schematic of the time domain OCT system operating at the central wavelength of 1280 nm, maximum average power 5 mW, delivered by a superluminescent diode model no. SLD-571, SUPERLUM, Moscow, Russia, with a 64.6-nm bandwidth, which represents an axial resolution of 11 m. As with the system in Fig. 1a, an all-fiber beamsplitter is used, but in this case the delay line is a Fourier domain delay line\footnote{Cense:2004p2285} consisting of a grating and a scanning galvo. The recombined beams are fed into a photodetector and associated electronics, and the output is sent to a personal computer with a LabView-based imaging program. 

The images of the remaining dentin thickness and pulp chamber were taken by scanning the oclusal surface in a vestibule-lingual direction. The laser penetrated into the teeth structure and a tomographic image of the frame, parallel to the axis of teeth was obtained. 

After the image construction by OCT 1280 and 850 nm, the teeth were tomographically analyzed using the i-CAT\textregistered Cone Beam Volumetric Tomography CBVT imaging system Imaging Sciences International, LLC, Pennsylvania, which radiates from an X-ray source in a cone shape, encompassing a large volume with a single rotation about the sample. This tomography system is a new technology used to analyze both double jaw anatomies in patients by dentistry when more accuracy is required on complementary exams. The CBVT produces volume imaging in an easier and faster way than conventional medical computed tomography\footcite{Danforth:2003p2286}. The scan offers times at 10, 20, and 40 s, with standard reconstruction taking <30 s, providing dentists with near-instant data for the best possible patient diagnosis, treatment, and surgical predictability. The pictures obtained are then reconstructed using algorithms to produce three-dimensional images at high resolution. Using the i-CAT software, it was possible to generate sliced 2-D images with thickness of 0.12 mm limited by the instrument resolution, eliminating the problem of superposition, and these images were then compared to the OCT images. 

\section{Results}

For comparison purposes, we first show in Figs. 2.a and 2.b images by i-CAT CBVT of the pulp chamber region studied. The white area is the dentin (D) part, whereas the pulp chamber (PC) region is the dark area inside. The square region marked is the zoom region shown in Fig. 2(b). The dimensions in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) are shown by the scales. Figure 2 shows a remaining dentin thickness of $\sim 120$ \textgreek{m}m, which was thick enough to avoid pulpar exposition.

The OCT images at the wavelengths of 1280 and 850 nm for the zoomed-in region shown in the i-CAT CBVT image of Fig. 2(b) are seen in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), respectively, which also show the structural components of the pulp-dentin complex. The structures in the OCT images are distinguished due to the different gray levels (or blue levels, in the case of the 850 nm system), where the contour of the chamber to pulp appears whiter (highest scattered intensities) and the dentin with the darker level (lowest scattered intensity). Those structures are clearly delineated due to influence of the structure of the biological components with distinct refractive indices, which backscatters light in very different ways. No pulp exposition is observed, as confirmed by the i-CAT CBVT, and comparing Figs. 2(b), 3(a), and 3(b), it clearly demonstrates the capacity of quantitative measurement by the OCT with remaining dentin thickness measured as $\sim 120$ \textgreek{m}m. Note that the measurements in the OCT value showed on the scale must be divided by the refraction index of dentine $\sim1.5$\footcite{ColstonJr:1998p1677} The black transversal region, indicated by the arrow in Fig. 3(a), is an artifact.

Figure 4 shows an image where the exposition of the pulp cavity is clearly seen. Figure 4(a) is the i-CAT CBVT image section, Fig. 4(b) the OCT at 1280 nm, and Fig. 4(c) the OCT at 850 nm. Once again, D and PC are clearly delineated in the OCT image. The pulp exposition site (PE) is seen as a discontinuity at the dentin surface, which is the homogenous white line of high intensity. The OCT images shown allow the direct measurement of the observed region depth.

In order to verify the maximum depth that could be achieved for each OCT system, we carried out a series of measurements whereby the studied dentin region was being reduced by polishing until the pulp could be identified. The scale shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) clearly demonstrate the capacity of quantitative assessment of the OCT, as well as the maximum penetration depth of the radiation inside of the dentin region. Comparing the measurements of the deeper ceiling of the pulp chamber visualized at the two different wavelengths 1280 and 850 nm, respectively¿, the remaining measured dentin thickness was $\sim 1000$ \textgreek{m}m at 1280 nm and 600 \textgreek{m}m at 850 nm system. These values had already been corrected for the dentin refractive index $\sim 1.5$\footcite{ColstonJr:1998p167}.

The deeper penetration depth of the light at 1280 nm compared to 850 nm is due to a remarkable reduction of absorption and scattering coefficients of the dentin at 1280 nm.23

As a final example, Fig. 6 shows a superposition of three different images from OCT at 1280 nm, taken at the same sample, showing the view of the longitudinal slice detecting cusps (C), D, and the vestibular and palatine pulp horn, where it is possible to identify a remaining thin layer of dentin of roughly 260 and 600 \textgreek{m}m (PC1 and PC2) between the cavity floor and pulp chamber. This is another clear demonstration of the potential of OCT for pulp chamber assessment.

\section{Discussion}

Citotoxicity of the dental material, deep cavity preparation, and accidental exposition of pulp tissue are factors that can be involved with the pulp irritation. The OCT is a new modality of image capable to diagnose the complex dentin pulp and to produce images through the dentin substratum, being able to measure with precision the distance between the endings of the cavity to pulp chamber. OCT provided images into reminiscent dentinal to pulp cavity of about 1000 \textgreek{m}m (1280 nm) and 600 \textgreek{m}m (850 nm) in depth.

Before any restoring procedure, care must be taken to properly evaluate and protect the dentine and the pulp against physical, chemical, and bacterial aggressions. The protection strategies depend basically on the depth of the cavity, the age of the patient, the remaining dentine thickness, and the indicated restoring material. The depth is determined by the remaining dentine thickness between cavity floor and the pulp chamber¿s ceiling.24 The remaining dentin thickness of 500 \textgreek{m}m should be enough to protect the pulp tissue against the cytotoxic effects of dental materials,25 and the remaining dentin thickness of 300 \textgreek{m}m may provoke a persistent inflammatory pulpal response. As expected, these results show that the greater the dentin thickness is, the more minor the injuries suffered for the pulp are.26

The OCT is a potential image technique that may contribute to prevent accidental pulp exposures in clinical practice and help pulp protection, by quantitatively determining the remaining dentin, thus helping to make the excavation procedures more predictable and safe.

\section{Conclusion}

The OCT clearly demonstrate the capacity of quantitative asgcsessment and penetration of the radiation on the pulp chamber and the remaining dentin, compared to the scan in i-CAT CBVT. In accordance with the results presented for the OCTs with a wavelength of 1280 and 850 nm, the two techniques presented effectiveness. Furthermore, our experiment corroborated the depth of penetration almost two times bigger for 1280 nm OCT. OCT is a noninvasive and nondestructive technique; as a consequence, it possesses great potential to be used routinely in clinical practice for the diagnosis of the complex dentin pulp, preventing accidental exposure of the pulp and promoting preventive restoration treatment. For practical use, a hand piece or an appropriate head for the imaging acquisition is required, which is a technologically solvable issue.


\section{abstract}

An optical coherence tomography (OCT) system with 6 lm spatial resolution
was employed to image the sites of fracture initiation and slow crack
propagation in a fiber reinforced composite. Bar specimens (2 mm ·
3 mm · 25 mm) of fiber reinforced composite were mechanically and
thermally cycled to emulate oral conditions. The interior of the samples
were analyzed prior and after the emulations. We analyzed the specimens
that were intact after the loading cycling. The results demonstrated
the capacity of the OCT technique to generate images of the sites
fracture initiation, crack propagation, and regions surrounding the
fracture, and it can be used in the future for quantitative analysis
thus complementing other existing methods, with the main advantage
of being non-destructive and noninvasive.


\section{Intro}

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is now a well established non-invasive
imaging technique with real-time capability, as reviewed in {[}1\textendash{}3{]}.
It has been applied to a variety of studies and clinical trials in
different health related areas, including dermatology {[}3{]}, dentistry
{[}4{]} and ophthalmology {[}5{]}, among others {[}3{]}. The key elements
of an OCT setup include a broadband source, whose spectral width limits
the axial spatial resolution; an interferometer, which generally
employs a Michelson design containing in of the arms the sample
and in the other arm a delay line and an optical detector, whose signal
output is electronically treated and fed to a computer for the image
generation. Two domains can be exploited for implementation of an
OCT system: the time domain or the spectral domain. In the time domain,
the optical delay line arm basically consists of either a movable
arm or a Fourier domain delay line {[}3{]}. It has been shown more
recently that spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) has several advantages
over the time domain OCT, including sensitivity {[}6{]} and fast
acquisition data, and since the first report on imaging implementation
{[}7{]} its use has been widespread {[}3,6,8{]}. The SD-OCT can be
implemented in two ways: either spectrally resolving the signal, as
described in Ref. {[}7{]}, or spectrally scanning the optical source,
as demonstrated later {[}3{]}. The purpose of this in vitro study
was to analyze the fracture propagation on fiber reinforced composites
by SD-OCT. Fiber reinforced composites (FRC) have been used for a
variety of dental applications, including tooth splinting, replacement
of missing teeth, treatment of dental emergencies, and reinforcement
of resin provisional fixed prosthodontic restorations, orthodontic
retention, and other clinical applications. Different fiber types
are available, but little clinical information has been disseminated.
The traditional microscopy investigation, most commonly used to study
this material, is a destructive technique, which requires specimen
sectioning and are essentially surface measurements. On the basis
of these considerations, we employed SD-OCT to analyze non-destructively
and non-invasively the interior of a dental sample reinforced with
fiber, after it has undergone a mechanical and thermal cycling to
emulate oral conditions. In the long-term, fractures allow bacterial
invasion provoking plaque and calculus formation that can cause
caries and periodontal disease. Therefore, non-invasive imaging of
the bridge fiber enables the possibility of periodic clinical evaluation
to ensure the patient health. Furthermore, OCT images can provide
a powerful method for quantitative analysis of fracture initiation
and crack propagation, and can potentially be used for in vivo assessment.


\section{Experimental details}

Fig. 1 shows the SD-OCT experimental set up. A titanium:sapphire
mode-locked optical oscillator, operating at 800 nm with a spectral
width of 10 nm and emitting pulses of 150 fs, was used as the initial
system light source. The laser beam was coupled into 2.2 m of a monomode
fiber (FS-SN-4224, Thorlabs), leading to a spectral broadening,
due to dispersive self-phase modulation {[}9\textendash{}11{]}. The
initial 10 nm spectral width and 500 mW of power was broadened to
50 nm as shown in Fig. 2, which could lead to a higher longitudinal
spatial resolution (DZ). In the Z direction, resolution can be calculated
from the expression DZ = 0.44k2/Dk {[}3{]}, which gives a value of
5.6 lm in air. The light was shone in a free space Michelson interferom-
eter. In one arm (reference arm) the light was reflected back to the
interferometer by a mirror fixed to a piezoelectric translator controlled
by PC via parallel port. The longitudinal displacement of the piezoelectric
was regulated using a simple voltage divider circuit. A variable attenuator
was used to control the amount of light returning to the beam splitter.
In the other arm (objective arm) an achromatic lens with focal length
of 50 mm was used to focus the light on the sample, providing a lateral
resolution of 30 lm. The dispersion caused by the focusing lens was
matched in the reference arm using a piece of glass. We used a computer
controlled three dimensional step motor translator (Z625B, Thorlabs)
to scan the sample transversally while making the acquisition. The
output light was then coupled into handheld spectrometer (USB2000,
Ocean Optics). The basic principle behind the spectral domain OCT
is the clever use of the Wiener\textendash{}Khinchin theorem, that
relates the light spectrum with its autocorrelation function. Although
the basic theory of SD-OCT has been described before {[}7{]}, we describe
here some important equations for the sake of clarity and completeness.
Considering E(t) as being the input light\textquoteright{}s electric
field, the electric field in the output put of the interferometer
can be modeled as being:

\includegraphics{/Users/bernardo/Dropbox/thesis/pasted9}

In Eq. (1) Kr, (Ki) is the fraction of input light power that was
reflected in a point r, (i) back to the interferometer, sr, (si)
is the time of flight the light takes to go from an input point to
the point r, (i) and then to the output. The subscript r refers to
the reference arm and i refers to a point in the sample. The autocorrelation
of the output electric field function is then:

\includegraphics{/Users/bernardo/Dropbox/thesis/pasted10}

In Eq. (2), C(t) represents the autocorrelation of the input light
and Dsn,m = sm sn. Since the input light has a large bandwidth then,
due to the uncertainty principle which leads to the time-bandwidth
product being a constant, C(t) is a highly sharp function at it\textquoteright{}s
origin. The first two terms in Eq. (2) are parasitic terms that will
be removed later, whilst the last terms are symmetric functions that
contain the information about the sample. Since sr is constant,
it can be seen that in each of the two last terms there is going to
be a peak centralized at Dsr,i, with amplitude proportional to the
squared root of the fraction of light power that returned from the
sample from point i. The idea is that the autocorrelation function
can be computed through the Wiener\textendash{}Khinchin theorem
by taking the Fourier transform of the power spectrum density Gout(m)
of the light coming out of the interferometer.

Fig. 3a shows the experimentally obtained autocorrelation of the
output light of our SD-OCT system with a mirror as a sample. The
central peak in the graph corresponds to the first parasitic term
of Cout(t), and the other two symmetric peak correspond to the last
two terms, where Dl is the difference of distance the light traveled
to go to the reference and sample mirror. To eliminate the parasitic
and one of the symmetric terms a second spectrum Gp=2 of the out output
light is taken, this time with the reference mirror displaced by a
distance of d = k/8. This will cause a phase shift of p/2 on the spectrum
fringes. It can be shown that using the relation:

\includegraphics{/Users/bernardo/Dropbox/thesis/pasted11}

a free of parasitic and symmetric signal can be obtained. Where the
Fourier Transform was denoted as FT and the complex number norm was
represented by jj jj. A result of this algorithm can be seen in (b),
which shows the experimental result obtained with the displacement
of d = k/8 introduced by the piezoelectric, where the central parasitic
and one of the symmetric peaks has suppressed with an efficiency
of at least 32 dB. A closer look at the peak, Fig. 3c shows the system
experimental resolution of 6 \textpm{} 0.5 lm, quite close to the
theoretically calculated value of 5.6 lm. With 2 mW of optical power
incident on the sample, a system sensibility of 98 \textpm{} 5 dB
was measured independently, following the procedure of Ref. {[}6{]}.
The figure is within the estimated value of 95 dB. The high sensibility
error is attributed manly due to the light source instability. The
data acquisition and image generation were controlled by a Labview
supported software. The software acquired two sets of spectra, each
with a different displacement in the reference arm. The acquisition
was done while the sample was transversally moved after a couple of
spectra were measured. Using spline interpolation, a spectra with
points evenly distributed in frequency was obtained from a spectra
that was evenly distributed in wavelength. Then, from each couple
of spectra a tomogram was calculated using Eq. (3). During the scan
all tomograms are laterally stacked forming a 2D matrix. By mapping
a color (or gray intensity) to each value of the 2D matrix an image
of the scanned sample is reconstructed.


\section{Fiber reinforced composite studies}

In the oral cavity, prosthetic reconstructions are usually under conditions
of thermal variation and loading conditions. Such thermal cycling
and cycling loading may cause fractures during long-term clinical
use {[}12,13{]}. Fatigue fracture after years in clinical use was
found to be a common failure reason. The longevity of restorations
is dependent upon many factors, including operator skill, the materials
and techniques used, the criteria for replacement, patient compliance
with oral hygiene advice, the oral environment and its contribution
to the patient\textquoteright{}s susceptibility to caries and possibly,
the means by which the treatment is funded. Relatively few studies
have investigated these factors {[}14{]}. Fatigue in dental restoratives
is also influenced by corrosive water attack at a certain temperature
(37\textdegree{}) and by cycling masticatory forces. The naturally
occurring loading of a filling was estimated {[}15{]} at between 5
and 20 MPa. Contemporary approaches to fatigue principles consider
a fracture process in three phases: crack initiation, slow crack
growth, and fast fracture. The latter phase is very short in duration
and thus the time of crack initiation and of slow crack growth account
for the useful fatigue resistance of a material. Crack initiation
nucleates at heterogeneities like surface and subsurface microcracks,
porosities, filler particles, crazes, etc. within the materials. Cycling
loading is able to drive a crack, called slow crack growth. Additional
water exposure causes a variety of weakening effects on resin composites:
degradation of the filler-matrix interface, elation, and swelling
or a viscoelastic effect on the matrix which all accelerate slow
crack growth {[}16{]}. To assess the possibility of fracture initiation
and crack evolution analysis, sample bars of dimensions 2 mm · 3 mm
· 25 mm were prepared. Using a split mold, 1 mm- layer of particulate
filler CR (Suprafill 3M/ESPE) was placed into the split mold, then
a dental fiber DF (Interlig, Angelus) was placed. Another layer of
CR was applied immediately after polymerization of DF on the top of
the fiber reinforced composite (FRC) substructure, leaving the thickness
of the specimen at 2.00 mm. The light polymerization was performed
with a halogen light. Fig. 4a shows a photograph of a section of the
FRC where we can see the fiber. The OCT image, Fig. 4b, confirms the
ability to see the substructure of the composite. Because of the refractive
index of the resin the vertical dimensions inside sample needs to
be corrected by a factor of 1.5. Before the load test, all the specimens
were thermally cycled in 1000 cycles between 5 and 55 \textdegree{}C.
The thermal cycling consisted of a 5 s transfer between temperature
baths. From the OCT images, no difference in the samples were detected
by analyzing the images before and after the thermal cycles {[}17{]}.

For the mechanical cycling, the specimens were tested in three points
loading, depicted in Fig. 5, in a universal testing machine (Kratos
Equipamentos Industriais LTDA, SP, Brazil). The load was applied to
standard bar specimens with a loading angle of 90\textdegree{}, a
crosshead speed of 3.0 mm/min and the distance between the two supports
was 8 mm. Cyclic loading was carried out to 100 cycles or until the
specimens failed. Fig. 6a and b show the OCT images of the sample,
for a particular cycling load of 60 N. The images were taken as schematized
in Fig. 5. Scanning was not straightforward because the cycling cracked
the resin surface leaving particles that scattered the light obfuscating
the region below the point of contact and often saturating the detector.
There are three characteristics regions surrounding the fracture origin
on the fracture surface of brittle material. The first region is generally
a relatively smooth (mirror) region, the second is a slightly stippled
(mist) region and the third is a very coarse (hackle) region. This
last region leads to macroscopic crack branching that is, the bifurca-
tion of the main crack. The formation of these three regions occurs
at a constant characteristic stress intensity factor {[}18{]}. In
Fig. 6a, left hand side, it is shown the OCT image prior the cycling.
Capital A indicates the image of dental fiber and capital B shows
the distance from the surface of beam to the top of dental fiber (about
400 lm). On the right hand side, Figure (b), shows the results after
cycling where the capital letters indicates: C-Flaw initiation site,
D-Splinter region, E-Hackle region. We can note the extension of
propagation about 900 lm from the flow initiation site to the end
of hackle region. This result demonstrates the possibility to study
how crack initiates and propagates inside the dental material. It
should be pointed out that, at 40 N load (not shown) the crack starts
to form, but the resin is still intact. At 80 N load, the sample was
fractured.


\section{Conclusions}

In conclusion, we have used the SD-OCT technique to generate images
of a FRC embedded in a composite resin. The Ti-sapphire-optical fiber
combination used as an optical source of broadband emission, giving
a practical axial resolution of 6 lm could be substituted by a simpler
source, such as a super luminescent LED, provided it delivered an
axial resolution of the order of 10\textendash{}15 lm. The results
demonstrated the capacity of the OCT technique to generate images
of the sites fracture initiation, crack propagation, and, regions
surrounding the fracture. Similar images could be obtained with time
domain OCT, but SD-OCT is more practical due to its improved sensitivity
and fast acquisition data, besides higher stability as there is no
movable part. The measurements were performed in phantoms, but it
is known that the penetration depth in real tooth can cover the whole
enamel extension {[}19{]} and therefore imaging fiber to a 2 mm depth
is feasible in real life. The use of 1300 nm wavelength, which has
a higher penetration depth in enamel, will provide penetration depth
up to 5\textendash{}6 mm {[}20{]}.

Since fracture is a major reason for clinical failure of dental restoration,
and is generally preceded by slow crack propagation, the method shown
here can be used for analysis of in-service failure of dental materials
and, although it was only qualitatively analyzed here, it can be used
in the future for quantitative analysis thus complementing other methods
{[}21{]}.


\chapter{Clinical use of optical coherence tomography to evaluate the integrity
of dental restorations}


\section{abstract}

We have applied Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) clinically to assess dental restorations in humans. Twenty patients with resin composite restorations in anterior teeth were selected and evaluated using a conventional radiographic examination, visual inspection and OCT. Images were obtained using a home built OCT system operating in the spectral domain, with an 850 nm superluminescent diode light source. The results were analyzed with respect to the integrity and marginal adaptation of the restoration. Using appropriate software failed and failing restorations, including those with lesioned regions, could be located prior to the placement of a new restoration. Lesions and failed restorations were identified with the OCT system that could not be seen by conventional visual and X-ray examinations and these were found to be present on surgical intervention. This in vivo study demonstrates that the OCT technique has a great potential to be used in clinical practice to assess dental restorations and prevent recurrent caries.  

\section{Introduction}

In recent years, several methods using light have been proposed to address the need for better detection and diagnostic tools in dentistry. Digital imaging fibre-optic transillumination (DIFOTI), multi-photon imaging, quantitative light fluorescence (QLF), infrared fluorescence (DIAGNOdent), infrared thermography, Raman spectroscopy, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and terahertz imaging are a few techniques that are currently under evaluation for improved diagnosis\footcite{Hall:2004p1838,Fried:2005p1836,Alex:2005p1695,ChooSmith:2008p1834}.
  
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a recent, but well established low-coherence interferometric technique that allows the acquisition of high-resolution, non-invasive, cross-sectional images of biological tissue based on the detection of backscattered light \footcite{Huang:1991p1955,Bouma:2002p2007}.

OCT has already been applied in vitro and in vivo to a variety of medical specialties, including Ophthalmology\footcite{Huang:1991p1955} , Dermatology \footcite{Pierce:2004p1839}, Gastroenterology \footcite{Tearney:1996p2052}, Cardiology\footcite{Boppart:1997p1840} and Cellular Engineering \footcite{Yang:2006p2053}.

The first study applying OCT to be carried out in Dentistry, both in vitro and in vivo, was in 1998, using a prototype handpiece for the characterization of both hard and soft dental tissues \footcite{ColstonJr:1995p1719,Feldchtein:1996p111}. In 2003, a commercial prototype OCT system was adapted to a commercial surgical microscope to perform in vitro and in vivo images of carious lesions and restorations \footcite{Brandenburg:2003p2055}. OCT has also been employed for the early detection of oral cancer \footcite{Jung:2005p2056}. In vitro studies evaluating enamel interface restoration \footcite{DeMelo:2005p2100}, early caries diagnostics \footcite{Freitas:2009p2142}, and analysis of the performance of dental materials\footcite{Braz:2009p2143} have also been reported. In 2006, the first OCT image of dental pulp was performed using rat's teeth \footcite{Kauffman:2006p2144}. Recently, remaining dentin and the pulp chamber from human teeth were also imaged by OCT in vitro as reported in \footcite{Fonseca:2009p1}. Endodontic applications of OCT have been explored in order to evaluate root canals \footcite{Shemesh:2007p1843} and Sinescu and co-workers used OCT to investigate the marginal adaptation of fixed dental prosthesis before installing them in patients \footcite{Sinescu:2009p2146}.  However, little work has been reported on OCT being used in a clinical setting as part of a clinical evaluation, specifically looking at restoration integrity.

Dental restorations provide a barrier restricting oral fluids and bacteria from entering the tooth after the removal of any damaged or missing tissue. An inadequate marginal seal can result in gap formation that leads to microleakage, which may be OCT has already been applied in vitro and in vivo to a variety of medical specialties, including Ophthalmology \footcite{Huang:1991p1955}, Dermatology {\footcite{Pierce:2004p1839}, Gastroenterology \footcite{Tearney:1996p2052}, Cardiology \footcite{Boppart:1997p1840} and Cellular Engineering \footcite{Yang:2006p2053}. responsible for marginal breakdown, recurrent caries, increased post-operative sensitivity, pulpal inflammation, and staining \footcite{Attar:2008p2147}.

Microleakage, either from small or microscopic openings between the margins of the composite restoration and tooth is considered to be a major cause of restoration failure\footcite{Xie:2008p2148}. Microleakage can also result in bacteria penetrating the tooth-restoration space and into dentinal tubules, where secondary decay may occur and bacterial toxins will irritate the pulp. The oral environment, including occlusal forces and temperature variation, as well as the differences between the physical properties of teeth and restorative materials, polymerization shrinkage, the coefficient of thermal expansion, and modulus of elasticity can all contribute to microleakage. According to previous literature, if poor bond strength exists between the tooth and restorative material, a failure of adhesion may be caused by polymerization shrinkage, and microscopic gaps at the tooth-restoration interface can subsequently form \footcite{DeMelo:2005p2100,Attar:2008p2147,Xie:2008p2148}.

The success of the restorative treatment depends on the integrity of the tooth-restoration interface and this particular region is the subject of much research and discussion in the Dental community. Clinically, the most common tools for detection of restorative failures are by tactile and/or visual inspection or by radiographic examination. However, since initial microleakages can be clinically and radiographically imperceptible, secondary caries may currently progress before the problem can be detected by the dental practitioner.

A recent study evaluating the enamel-restoration interface using OCT, in which just one patient was reported, has been published  and Negritu et al.\footcite{Negrutiu:2009p2189} used OCT and confocal microscopy to investigate
dental structures and restoration materials using extracted teeth.

Here we present an in vivo study employing a home built OCT system, operating in the spectral domain using a superluminescent diode at 850 nm, to detect failures at the enamel-dental restoration interface, and the integrity of superficial and internal structures of restorations in a clinical setting. This study was undertaken with 20 patients attending the Dentistry College of the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco.  The relatively large number of attending patients allowed us to obtain and analyze the results in a very consistent manner. Results were compared to conventional radiographs and clinical examination, represented here by photographs.  

\section{Material and Methods}

This study was developed according to the guidelines given by Ethical Committee in Human Research of the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Brazil. Twenty patients with resin composite restorations in upper anterior teeth were selected. These patients were between 18 and 45 years old, both male and female, and had their restorations performed between 1999 and 2009. All the restorations had a superficial satisfactory clinical aspect with no obvious aesthetic failures such as staining, undesirable shape or obvious missing material.

OCT performs high-resolution, cross-sectional tomographic imaging of the internal microstructure in materials and biological systems by measuring backscattered or backreflected light. The intensity of the signal is a function of the scattering caused by the local changes in tissue structure of the tooth. Variations in scattering measured in relation to depth from a single point on the tooth surface are called an \textquotedbl{}A-scan\textquotedbl{}. Taking several A-scans along a line produces information from a 'slice' of tooth tissue, which is the tomogram. The movement along the line of A-scans is known as the \textquotedbl{}B-scan\textquotedbl{} \footcite{Hall:2004p1838}.

The key elements of an OCT system include a broadband light source, whose spectral width largely sets the axial spatial resolution; an interferometer, which generally employs a Michelson design, with one of the arms containing the sample and in the other arm, a delay line; and an optical detector, whose signal output is electronically treated and fed to a computer for the image generation. In the spectral domain (SD-OCT), there are no movable parts in the interferometer arms (except for lateral displacement of the beam on the sample), and the recombined beams from the interferometer are sent to a spectrometer and are Fourier analyzed \footcite{Wojtkowski:2002p3}.

The schematic diagram of the home-built OCT operating in the spectral domain, which was used in this study is shown in figure 1(a), and is the same as reported previously\footcite{Fonseca:2009p1} where the full experimental details are described. The centre wavelength of the system was selected to be around 850 nm. Although longer wavelengths penetrate more deeply into the sample due to a lower scattering coefficient, this lower scattering coefficient also means a loss of sensitivity to slight changes in refractive indices. In order to maximize the sensitivity to changes we therefore opted for a shorter wavelength compared to the 1300 nm that reported previously \footcite{Negrutiu:2009p2189}.

In summary, the output emission from a superluminescent diode (Broadband SLD Lightsource S840, SUPERLUM, Moscow, Russia) operating at 850 nm, with a spectral width of 49.9 nm and a fiber output power 25 mW was sent to a Michelson interferometer setup providing an axial resolution of 6 \textgreek{m}m. In the reference arm a mirror was mounted on a piezoelectric base, whilst in the sample arm, a mirror controlled by a Galvanometer motor was used to scan the light on the sample.  The reflected and back- scattered light coming from both arms was then recombined at the beam splitter and collected by a spectrometer.

The maximum incident power on the sample was approximately 5 mW. The beam incident on the sample was focused using an achromatic 50 mm focal length (numerical aperture = 0.25) lens. For a typical beam diameter of 1 mm before the focusing lens, the lateral resolution was 54m. The axial resolution is set, predominantly, by the bandwidth of the source, whereas the lateral resolution is determined by the numerical aperture of the final lens system. The lateral resolution is thus a compromise between the working distance and size of the final lens. To increase the lateral resolution one would shorten the working distance of the system, making it less useful for clinical applications, thus we opted for a lateral resolution of 54 microns and an acceptable working distance of around 50mm.

This optical delivery system was mounted on a 2D translation stage, though as the beam passes off a scanning galvo, this is used to scan either in the X or Y direction for data acquisition and only one axis of the translation stage was used for lateral movement of the imaging system. The control of the scanning systems was undertaken by a personal computer with a LabView based imaging program. A photograph of the entire system is shown in figure 1(b).

The signal produced by the spectrometer was also sent to the same computer which thus both controlled the scanning and data processing.  The software generated an image into a fixed size screen (stored as a .png file) and a numeric array matrix (stored as a .dat file) containing the information about the A-scans and B-scan of each image, composed by 512 lines and 512 columns. As the LabView screen had a fixed size, the image file presented distortions along its longitudinal axis but provided the clinician with a real time image of the area under examination.  The correctly sized image was obtained through subsequent manipulation of the .dat using the Image J software (NIH, USA). These processed images enabled the exact position of any restoration failure to 7 be seen clearly through the use of an appropriate colored look-up table and subsequently located and precisely measured.
  
To perform the OCT examination, a lip retractor was used on the patients, and their heads were positioned in an appropriate support, in front of the sample arm, seen in figures 1(b) and 1(c). The image acquisition time is less than one second (for each image, there was 0.1 second of pre-scan settling time and 80 \textgreek{m}s of integration time) though the support was used to minimize movement which would otherwise blur the high optical resolution images. The authors analyzed the results with respect to the integrity and marginal adaptation of the restoration by visual inspection of the images in real time as well as on the images produced from the subsequent image processing.

As comparison criteria to OCT, we employed the diagnostic methods most widely used in dentistry: a clinical examination composed of visual and/or tactile inspection (shown in this paper by photographs) and a conventional X-ray. The dental X-Ray equipment used was the Spectro 70X (Dabi Atlante, Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil), operating at 70 kVp head power and a head current of 8 mA. The radiographic film used was Kodak Dental Intraoral E-Speed Film (Carestream Health Inc., Rochester, New York, United States), and the dental developer and fixer, was from the same manufacturer.

During a clinical examination, it is possible to detect changes in resin composite color, polishing failures, contact point problems and major gaps and fissures; radiographic images can show excess or lack of restorative material, large areas of demineralization (typically greater than 30\% of mineral loss), and gaps or fractures points larger than the minimum detection size observed by OCT. A well designed OCT system, on the other hand, is able to indicate micrometer sized external problems such as superficial cracks, and internal defects (air bubbles, cracks and their respective 8 growth, voids, gaps and fissures) as well as the characteristics of a specific composite material.

To evaluate the presence, or otherwise, of failures in the restorations, three experienced professionals, all of them Restorative Dentistry professors, were trained to interpret OCT images. Each professor was then individually shown the clinical photograph of each restoration in question, and requested to complete a form describing what they could see in that patient's image in terms of the restoration extension, and if there was any form of failure. In case of detected failure they were then asked to classify the failure. Then, the radiographic images were shown, in the same way and, last, the OCT images. To analyze the data a Kappa coefficient test was applied.  Kappa coefficient is a statistical measure of the agreement for qualitative/categorical items; its aim is not to compare the diagnostic potential between the three techniques employed, but to compare how the evaluators agree among themselves in each form of diagnostic technique separately. After the analysis all of the patients that presented failures in their restorations were recalled to the clinic and had new procedures performed after a discussion with the patient following the approved clinical procedure.


\section{Results}

OCT images were obtained from vertical slices of the tooth, as indicated in figure 2. The scan was always mapped from left to right. The lateral distance between each image was 0.2 mm. For didactic reasons, we have only shown some tomograms of each tooth. The upper part of image corresponds to the cervical region and the lower part, the incisal region.

Features seen in the OCT images were interpreted by reference to the literature and also to previous ex vivo studies by the authors, where the teeth were imaged via OCT and subsequently sectioned and histologically studied by light microscopy. It can be shown in figure 3, in which 3(a), 3(c), 3(e) and 3(g) represent OCT images of different samples
restored in composite resin, and 3(b), 3(d), 3(f) and 3(h), their respective optical microscopy images. In figures 3(a) and 3(b) we can see an example of a well placed and sound restoration, whilst 3(c)/3(d) and 3(e)/3(f) show the air bubble presence (within the circle) close to the tooth restoration interface, as well as the dentin-enamel junction. The white appearance of the air bubbles in the optical microscopy images is due to the smear layer impregnation during the teeth sectioning with diamond wheel. Figures 3(g) and 3(h) show an aesthetic facet, in which is possible to observe the tooth-restoration limits (arrows), the dentin-enamel junction and, specially, the use of different shades of composite resin (large rectangles).

Table 1 indicates a comparison between all the methods used in this work for the first three cases.

Figure 4 shows a sequence of examinations of a patient with a well placed and sound restoration in a central incisor, placed seven years previously. Figure 4(a) represents the clinical examination; 4(b), the conventional radiograph showing the restoration at the incisal region in the circle. Arrows in 4(c) indicate the interface between the enamel and the restorative material, which can be clearly seen.

{[}Fig. 4{]}

Figure 5(a) shows a lateral incisor with an aesthetic facet (not polished) over an incisal and cervical restorations, confirmed by radiography in figure 5(b), performed 10 11 two weeks before the analysis reported here. In the OCT image, figure 5(b), an air bubble in the restoration (within the circle) can be seen and the dots indicate the points of microleakage at the enamel-restoration interface. The small rectangles indicate an extensive space under the restoration, probably due to resin polymerization contraction during the restorative procedure and the triangles indicate crack points between resin increments.

\begin{figure}[h]

Restorations involving medium and incisal regions of a central incisor, performed in 2001 in another patient are shown in figure 6, where Fig. 6(a) shows the clinical photograph with no sign of failure, and different colors between the resin composite and the dental enamel. In Fig. 6(b), the conventional radiograph, it is possible to observe excess restorative material at proximal surfaces; and Fig. 6(c) shows the OCT image sequence. The arrow here indicates the well placed enamel-restoration interface. However, several undesirable features can be identified: air bubble (within the circle); evidence of a gap between the enamel and the restorative material (identified by the dots); superficial defects and internal fractures in the resin composite (identified by the triangles).

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

In some cases, a restoration does not necessarily need to present failures throughout its entire structure to be considered for replacement and they may well show one part which is well placed and intact whilst another area has problems. This can also be seen in figures 6(c) and 7. In the first slice of Fig. 6(c), we can see an arrow that indicates the well placed enamel-restoration interface, but in subsequent slices, we can see some failures, described previously. The same situation can be seen in figure 7, with a restoration involving medium and incisal regions. Arrows indicate the well placed 12 enamel-restoration interface; dots indicate enamel-restoration microleakages; triangles indicate evidence of superficial fissures at the resin composite; another feature is the different pseudo color of the resin composite at the incisal region when compared to medium region, marked with the large rectangles.  This can be seen by OCT because lighter colors of resin have lower refractive indices, and thus this modifies the scattering in this region.

%
\begin{figure}[h]
\noindent \begin{centering}
\input{claudiaFig7.pdf_tex}\caption{}
\par\end{centering}
\end{figure}


In figure 8, we can see a sequence of failures over the entire structure of an incisal restoration (dots), beside the dentin-enamel junction.

Finally, in figure 9, we can observe three different aesthetic facets.  In the region indicated by the diamonds, problems with the cervical adaptation of the restorations are identified in Figs. 9(a) and 9(b), whereas a well suited adaptation is seen in Fig. 9 (c). None of these clinically important defects, seen by OCT, could be observed in the clinical images and X-rays, even when they were subsequently examined after the detecting a problem in the OCT data sets.

Table 2 shows the Kappa coefficient results for each form of diagnostic examination. It can be seen that for clinical and radiographic examinations there was a substantial agreement between the evaluators, whilst for the OCT examinations the Kappa index obtained demonstrates perfect agreement: it means that the OCT images provide more accurate information to diagnostic than the clinical photographs and the X-ray exam. It was not possible to compare the kinds of failures seen in each type of examination, as the OCT is able to visualize internal structures that are impossible to be seen in the clinical inspection or radiographic examination.

\section{Discussion}

The improvements in the esthetic and physical properties of composite resins over the past ten years have established them as the material of choice for restorations of anterior teeth when used in conjunction with the acid-etch technique and dental bonding systems\footcite{Garoushi:2007p2191}.  However, their high aesthetic quality frequently makes it harder to see early signs of failure and due to the way that these materials behave, compared to traditional amalgam and gold restorations, early failure is more likely. Failures at the tooth-restoration interface can be associated with several factors including incorrect restorative technique, the physical properties of the materials used and, especially, the contraction of the material generated during the polymerization of the restorative material.

An adequate marginal adaptation and the integrity of the restoration are fundamental to the success of the dental treatment: failures in the marginal surface cause microleakage and bacteria infiltration; loss of integrity can be present in the internal or superficial structure of the restoration, and reduces the quality of the restoration, leading to early fracture of the restorative treatment. Some defects seen in this study are known to cause a loss of integrity in resin based composite restorations including air bubbles in the restoration, regions without material under the restoration (voids), cracks and fissures at the resin composite and gaps. When these kinds of failures are present and the restorative procedure is not adequate, a new treatment should be discussed with the patient.

Previous studies have shown some defects we have identified in this paper: the dentin enamel junction was evidenced by several authors\footcite{ColstonJr:1995p1719,Feldchtein:1996p111,Brandenburg:2003p2055}; Melo et al (2005)\footcite{DeMelo:2005p2100} presented induced marginal microleakage; Sadr et al (2009)\footcite{24} had shown the evolution of a marginal microleakage to a secondary caries with absence of restorative material under the restoration; the absence of restorative material in the interface between the restoration and the dental tissue (similar to that we have shown in figure 5), presence of gaps, as well as crack points of the restorative material were presented by Negritu et al (2009)\footcite{Negrutiu:2009p2189}; air bubble and gaps were also presented in the study performed by Feldchtein et al (1998)\footcite{Feldchtein:1996p111} and, finally, crack propagation into the resin composite was described by Braz et al (2009)\footcite{Braz:2009p2143}.

The current methods clinically used to diagnosis are not able to visualize micrometric structures. In the radiographic examination, for example, an early enamel caries lesion is visible only after approximately 30\%\textendash{}40\% mineral loss\footcite{White:2000p2224}. This deficiency makes it difficult to diagnose early recurrent caries, when an earlier diagnosis means an easier and less traumatic treatment, leaving more enamel present in the tooth after treatment.

The Kappa coefficient was applied to analyze the concordance index of the diagnosis of the professionals selected for each examination modality separately, and the OCT method demonstrated perfect agreement between the evaluators, while there was a substantial agreement for the clinical and radiographic examinations. This indicates that OCT, besides be a good tool for diagnosis can be consistently interpreted by well trained dentists. However, it was not possible to use a statistical test to compare the clinical, X-ray and OCT examinations simultaneously.  The first method (clinical observation) is only able to see defects at external surfaces; radiographic methods image across the tooth, but the resulting image inherently overlays the buccal and lingual 14 surfaces making it difficult to detect and determine internal problems.  OCT can produce two dimensional and cross-sectional images, allowing
the observer to see external and internal details, without overlap of structures, being able to accurately locate the visualized structures.  Thus teeth were visualized in different forms in each type of examination, but many of the minor defects (air bubbles, for example) only can be seen by OCT. However, all defects detected by clinical and X-ray examinations were also detected using the OCT protocol.

This study demonstrates that OCT is a powerful tool for the early detection of failures on restorations, through visualization of microleakages, internal fractures, superficial cracks and fissures, tooth demineralization under the restorative material and cervical adaptation of the restorations.  Incipient lesions can be precisely located, their depth may be measured and their proximity to the dentin-enamel junction may be determined.  The sensitivity of the OCT technique is sufficient such that details, including the use of different colors of resin composite used to increase the esthetic aspect of a restoration, can be identified due to the slightly different scattering properties (see figure 7).

As dentists are used to dental radiographs for diagnostic purposes, OCT imaging, which shows similar dental morphology, could be readily adopted\footcite{ChooSmith:2008p1834} and, ideally, the number of conventional X-ray investigations would be reduced in order to minimize the patients exposure to ionizing radiation\footcite{Brandenburg:2003p2055}.

However, it is necessary to recognize some limitations of OCT: the system has a small depth penetration, (1-3 mm in teeth), which is, however, adequate for enamel and even dentin visualization. This is partly because we chose to use light at 850nm in order to increase the contrast between areas with only slightly different scattering properties. The use of longer wavelength sources (around 1300nm), with some slight loss of 15 contrast, and hence sensitivity, may provide the best compromise between depth of imaging and sensitivity to minor alterations in structure. Furthermore, our current system does not allow the use of the technique in every tooth, just on incisors and canines. Thus for this first stage of our studies applying OCT in vivo, we only assessed anterior teeth, for two reasons: incisors and canines are the teeth that require better esthetic restorative procedures, and the unavailability of a handpiece probe, presently under development, to reach the posterior dentition.

The time acquisition for each image is less than one second; so considering that we performed one image at every 0.2 mm, and including the time to save the images, the complete examination takes between 2-4 minutes, depending of the tooth width.

Some difficulties were found during the data collection of this study: the major of them was to control the production of saliva and subsequent patient movement, which tended to produce image artifacts. Thus was minimized by careful explanation to the patient and the use of the stabilization bar. A further complication was to undertake the examinations in patients presenting a maxillary overjet (an orthodontic condition in which the third incisor is ahead of the cervical third in the upper incisors, and thus the teeth appear to be inclined horizontally) \textendash{} this problem was solved by requesting the patient to bow their head slightly but, in a long term, the solution is in the development of a handpiece probe.

The software in the current system does not permit the construction of volumetric three dimensional imaging generation that could present interesting visual effects and might provide the clinician, in the longer term, with novel and potentially useful views of the tooth.  This is an area for future study and here we have presented the data in a manner which is familiar to the dental practitioner, as a 2 dimensional data set, though their experience of X-rays.

Further clinical studies covering cervical adaptation of aesthetics-facets and fixed crowns are currently underway. The high sensitivity of OCT to minor defects also opens up a further clinical question over which minor defects will progress to server complications and which may stay at the minor level. The development of such revised treatment protocols is beyond the scope of the present study but it is an area that will need to be investigated as OCT moves towards a standard diagnostic instrument in clinical practice, as is the case with any new technological advance.

\section{Conclusion}

Compared to conventional radiography, OCT is a powerful tool for investigation of failures at the tooth-restoration interface. OCT is able to exactly visualize external and internal micrometric structures, not perceived by clinical examination or conventional radiography, proving its superiority as a technique for early diagnosis of restoration failures and prevention of recurrent caries. However, because of the low penetration depth of OCT, conventional radiography imaging may not be totally substituted.  This was a qualitative study applying OCT in dental clinics; we used conventional X-Ray, the most widely used modality of imaging for diagnostic assessment in dental clinics, and the clinical examination as the comparison for our study. We analyzed the differences between the modalities of exams mentioned above and the advantages and limitations of conventional radiography and OCT examinations. Besides other applications of the OCT technique in vivo, further complementary studies are under-way to determine dental composites failures in a quantitative manner,
as well as their size or extent.


\part{Optics on chip$ $}

It is unecessary to emphasize the importance of electronics integrated
circuits to the current world. But it is worth to investigate if it
is possible to create the same structure in different fields. In this
investigation one can notice the two crucial feature of the success.
The use of massivelly parallel device patterning enabled by photolitography
and the search to decrease device size to its physical limits.

Three ramification using the microfabrication process have come of
age in the last decade: Microfluidics, micro-mechanical devices (MEMs)
and integrated optics. Microfluidics enables the possibility of massive
chemical analysis which revolutionized genetic research, enabling
operation such as DNA sequencing to be performed at a fraction of
time that was done before{[}citation{]}. Micromechanical devices {[}weinstein
thesis{]}. Integrated optics which has the potential of large bandwidth
data transfer and spectroscopic analysis, and possibly quantum processing. 


\section{Broad picture}

The basic feature ones needs

The platform in which optic on chip works consists in the use of a
high index of refraction material surrounded by a material with lower
index of refraction to guide light in the higher refrative index material
using the total internal reflection. We call a slab waveguide when
a higher refractive index medium is cladded by a lower index medium
in only dimension. Light that is guided in the higher index material
can be treated a two dimensional wave. In this regime, knowledge of
free space optics can be applied to design devices. Components like,
lenses, mirrors, concave mirrors, prisms, gratings can be readliy
visualized{[}citations{]}{[}pictures{]}.

Another component is wire waveguide, where a high index of refraction
material is surrounded by lower index material in two dimension. This
structure transport light like electrons on copper wire. This structure
is widely used as fiber optics, where system built on fiber optics
can implemented on chip waveguides.

In chapter we are going to dicuss the physical principles necessary
to design components in integrated optics.

Attempts to fabricate on comercial foundries has been made\footcite{Orcutt:2008p1769}


\section{Slab waveguide}

%
\begin{figure}[h]
\noindent \centering{}\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figures/slab}\caption{}

\end{figure}


We define a slab waveguide as a system comprised of an infinite film
(which will be also referred as core) of thicknes $h$ and index of
refraction $n_{f}$ over a substrate with index of refraction $n_{s}$and
cladded by a material whose index of refraction is $n_{c}$. As stated
earlyer the index of refraction in the guiding film needs to be greater
than its surroundings, this condition is stated in the relation:\begin{equation}
n_{f}>n_{s}\geqslant n_{c}\label{refractiveIndexInequality}\end{equation}
where we left the inequality $n_{s}\geqslant n_{c}$ for sake of generallity
and we take the higher index of refraction index to be the substrate.

The Maxwell equation in frequency domain for given system is:

\begin{eqnarray}
\nabla\cdot\epsilon_{0}\epsilon\left(z\right)\mathbf{E}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right) & = & 0\label{1}\\
\nabla\times\mathbf{E\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right)} & = & i\omega\mu_{0}\mathbf{H}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right)\label{eq:3}\\
\nabla\cdot\mu_{0}\mathbf{H\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right)} & = & 0\label{eq:5}\\
\nabla\times\mathbf{H}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right) & = & -i\omega\epsilon_{0}\epsilon\left(z\right)\mathbf{E}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right)\label{eq:5-1}\end{eqnarray}
where the net charge charge and current density was considered zero,
and the permeability of the materials was considered to be $\mu_{0}$.
The relative dielectric constant in accordance with begining of the
section is:\begin{equation}
\epsilon\left(z\right)=\begin{cases}
n_{c}^{2}, & \text{if }z\ge h\\
n_{f}^{2}, & \text{if }0<z<h\\
n_{s}^{2}, & \text{if }z\le0\end{cases}\label{dielectricFunction}\end{equation}
Substituing the relative dielectric constant on the Maxwell's equation
we get three sets of Maxwell's equation with a constant dielectric
constant:

\begin{eqnarray}
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E}_{j}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right) & = & 0\label{1}\\
\nabla\times\mathbf{E}_{j}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right) & = & i\omega\mu_{0}\mathbf{H}_{j}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right)\label{eq:3}\\
\nabla\cdot\mu_{0}\mathbf{H}_{j}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right) & = & 0\label{eq:5}\\
\nabla\times\mathbf{H}_{j}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right) & = & -i\omega n_{j}^{2}\epsilon_{0}\mathbf{E}_{j}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right)\label{eq:5-1}\end{eqnarray}
where $j$ can be either $c$, $f$ or $s$ depending on $z$ as in
\ref{dielectricFunction}. We can use the above equation to derive
the non-coupled wave equation

\begin{eqnarray*}
\nabla^{2}\mathbf{E}_{j}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right)-k^{2}n_{j}^{2}\mathbf{E}_{j}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right) & = & 0\\
\nabla^{2}\mathbf{B}_{j}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right)-k^{2}n_{j}^{2}\mathbf{B}_{j}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right) & = & 0\end{eqnarray*}
\[
\begin{array}{c}
\nabla^{2}\mathbf{E}_{j}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right)-k^{2}n_{j}^{2}\mathbf{E}_{j}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right)=0\\
\nabla^{2}\mathbf{B}_{j}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right)-k^{2}n_{j}^{2}\mathbf{B}_{j}\left(\mathbf{r},\omega\right)=0\end{array},\text{ for }j=c,f,s\]
where $k=\frac{\omega}{\sqrt{\epsilon_{0}\mu_{0}}}$. The Ansatz to
the equation is a plane wave. 

Using the plane wave as the ansatz

Where standard plane wave ansatz can be used\[
\psi_{j}=A_{j}\exp\left[\mathbf{\bm{\beta}}\cdot\mathbf{R}+\kappa_{j}z\right]\]
where $\bm{\beta}=\beta_{x}\hat{x}+\beta_{y}\hat{y}$, $\mathbf{R}=x\hat{x}+y\hat{y}$
and\[
\beta^{2}+\kappa_{j}^{2}=n_{j}^{2}k^{2}\]
where $\beta=\mbox{\ensuremath{\left|\bm{\beta}\right|}}$

Boundary conditions couples a set of Maxwell equations, and therefore
its solutioXns, from one region to its neighboring region as follows:\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{z}\cdot\left(n_{k}^{2}\mathbf{E}_{k}-n_{j}^{2}\mathbf{E}_{j}\right) & = & 0,\\
\hat{z}\cdot\left(\mathbf{B}_{k}-\mathbf{B}_{j}\right) & = & 0,\\
\hat{z}\times\left(\mathbf{E}_{k}-\mathbf{E}_{j}\right) & = & 0,\\
\hat{z}\times\left(\mathbf{H}_{k}-\mathbf{H}_{j}\right) & = & 0,\end{eqnarray*}
where $k,j$ are either $c,f$ or $f,s$ and $\hat{z}$ is the unitary
vector normal to the interface between different materials. Applying
the boundary conditions, two sets solutions arise. Each set is characterised
by the abscence of the transversal component of either electric or
magnetic field. The solution which has no normal component of the
magnetic field is called TM and the solutions which the normal component
of the electric field are absent are called TE.

, the conditions arises\[
\tan hd_{f}=\frac{d_{f}\left(d_{c}+d_{s}\right)}{h^{2}-d_{c}d_{s}}\]
\[
d_{j}^{2}=\beta^{2}-k^{2}n_{j}^{2}\]

\section{Detectors}

Detector are the conversor from photonics to electronics. As with
light sources the material which the detector is made of needs to
be integrated to the rest of the circuit. The most used detector type
relies on the excitation of electrons from the valence band to the
conduction band of a semiconductor material, by the photons to be
detected. But other physical effects can be used to make detector.
{[}exemples{]}

Semiconductor detector, nevertheless, are the most used due to its
bandwidth, limited by the electron mobility which allows bandwidth

photons can be detected). Simplicity, in metal-semiconductor-metal
(MSM) the only thing needed is the detecting semiconductor material
and the metal contacts. Depoing the endpoints of the detector creating
a PIN structure will allow eliminate the need for an external voltage
drive.

It is difficult to enumerate all the contribuition to society that
diffraction grating has brought. Its role on identifying the discrete
energy levels of atoms provided a significant amount of information
to the development of quantum mechanics. Currently its use in the
identification or quantification of chemical compounds and its structure
constitutes the majority usage end of diffraction gratings.

\end{figure}


A diffraction grating may be defined as any arrangement which imposes
on an incident wave a periodic variation of amplitude of phase, or
both. We may characterize any particular grating by its \emph{transmission
function}\footcite{Born:2000p1607}, defined as follows:

Let a transparent or semitransparent object (not necessarily periodic)
cover a portion of a fictitious reference plane $\xi\eta$, and let
it be illuminated by a plane monochromatic wave incident in a direction
specified by the direction cosines $l_{0}$, $m_{0}$. Fig illustrates
the arrangement, the $\eta$-axis being perpendicular to the plane
of he drawing. If no object were present, the disturbance in the $\xi,\eta$-plane
would be represented by the function $V_{0}\left(\xi,\eta\right)=A\exp\left[ik\left(l_{0}\xi+m_{0}\eta\right)\right]$,
the factor $\exp\left(-i\omega t\right)$ being, as usual, omitted.
Because of the presence of the object disturbance will be modified
and may be represented by some other function, which we denote by
$V\left(\xi,\eta\right)$. The \emph{transmission function} of the
object is then defined as\[
F\left(\xi,\eta\right)=\frac{V\left(\xi,\eta\right)}{V_{0}\left(\xi,\eta\right)}.\]


In general $F$ depends, not only on $\xi$ and $\eta$ but also on
the direction $\left(l_{0},m_{0}\right)$ of illumination. The transmission
function is in general complex, since both the amplitude and the phase
of the light may be altered on the passing through the object. In
the special case when the object alters the amplitude but no the phase
of the incident wave (i.e. if arg $F\equiv0$), we speak of an \emph{amplitude
object}; if it alters the phase but not the amplitude (i. e. $\left|F\right|=1$)
we speak of a \emph{phase object}.

If we are concerned with reflected light rather than with light that
is transmitted by an object, it is more appropriate to speak of a
\emph{reflection function}, defined in a similar way, the only difference
being that the reference plane is on the same side of the object as
the incident light.

The ratio $\left|V/V_{0}\right|$ is practically unity for points
outside the geometrical shadow (whose boundary is represented by points
A and B in Figure) cast by the object. If the portion outside the
shadow region is covered by an opaque screen, the arrangements act
as a diffracting aperture A with a nonuniform pupil function. \st{If
the linear dimensions of A are large compared to the wavelength and
if F remains sensibly constant over regions whose dimensions are of
the same order as the wavelength, the diffraction formula remain valid
under the same conditions as before, provided that the integrand of
the diffraction integral is multiplied by F.}

(a) The normalized interference function\[
\frac{1}{N^{2}}H\left(N,kdp/2\right)=\left[\frac{\sin\left(Nkdp/2\right)}{N\sin\left(kdp/2\right)}\right]^{2}.\]
(b) The normalized intensity function of a slit\[
I^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)=\left[\frac{\sin ksp/2}{ksp/2}\right]^{2}.\]
(c) The normalized intensity function of a grating consiting of $N$
simliar equidistant parallel slits\[
\frac{1}{N^{2}}I\left(p\right)=\left[\frac{\sin\left(Nkdp/2\right)}{N\sin\left(kdp/2\right)}\right]^{2}\left[\frac{\sin ksp/2}{ksp/2}\right]^{2}.\]
Only the range $p\ge0$ is shown, all the curves being symetrical
about the vertical axis $p=0$.

Let us now consider a one-dimensional grating consisting of $n$ parallel
grooves of arbitrary profile, ruled on one surface of a plan-parallel
glass plate. Let the $\xi,\eta$-plane coincide with the plane face
of the plate, $\eta$ being the direction of the grooves and let $d$
be the period in the $\xi$ direction.

Assume that the direction of propagation of the wave incident upon
the grating is in the plane of the figure, making an angle $\theta_{0}$
with $O\zeta$, and let $\theta$ denote the angle which $O\zeta$
makes with the line joining a very distant point of observation P
with the grating.

As before we set $l_{o}=\sin\theta_{0}$, $l=\sin\theta$, $p=l-l_{0}=\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}$.
The complex amplitude at $P$ is then immediately obtained from, where
the integrand must be multiplied by the transmission function $F$
of one periodic element. We may set $q=0$ and\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\xi_{n}=nd, & \eta_{n}=0 & \left(n=0,1,\ldots,N-1\right)\end{array}.\]


We the obtain\begin{equation}
U\left(p\right)=U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}e^{-ikndp}=U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\frac{1-e^{-iNkdp}}{1-e^{-kdp}},\label{eq: Up}\end{equation}
where\begin{equation}
U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)=C\int_{A}\! F\left(\xi\right)e^{-ikp\xi}\, d\xi.\label{eq: diffraction envelope}\end{equation}


Hence\[
I\left(p\right)=\left|U\left(p\right)\right|^{2}=\frac{\left(1-e^{-Nkdp}\right)}{\left(1-e^{-kdp}\right)}\cdot\frac{\left(1-e^{Nkdp}\right)}{\left(1-e^{kdp}\right)}\left|U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\right|^{2}=\frac{1-\cos Nkdp}{1-\cos kdp}I^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right),\]
 where $I^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)=\left|U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\right|^{2}$.
If we introduce the function\[
H\left(N,x\right)=\left(\frac{\sin Nx}{\sin x}\right)^{2},\]
 the formula 5 for the intensity may be written as\[
I\left(p\right)=H\left(N,\frac{kdp}{2}\right)I^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right).\]


Before discussing the implications of this basic formula we note that
according to \ref{eq: Up}. The light distribution is the same as
that due to a set of coherent secondary sources each characterized
by the same amplitude function $\left|U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\right|$
and with phases that differ form each other by integral multiples
of $kdp$. To see the significance of this phase difference consider
two corresponding points $A$ and $B$ in the neighboring grooves
of the grating. Since the effect of the grating is to impress a periodic
variation onto the incident wave, it follows that the path difference
between the light arriving a $A$ and at $B$ is the same as in the
absence of the grating, i.e. it is equal to $AK=d\sin\theta_{0}$,
$K$ denoting the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ on to the ray
incident at $A$. Further, the light path from $B$ in the direction
$\theta$ exceeds the light path from $A$ by $BL=d\sin\theta$, $L$
being the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ on to the ray diffracted
at $B$ in the direction $\theta.$ Hence the total path difference
between light arriving at the distant point of observation form corresponding
points in two neighboring grooves is\begin{equation}
BL-AK=d\left(\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}\right)=dp,\label{eq: path difference}\end{equation}
 and the corresponding phase difference is $2\pi dp/\lambda=kdp$.

Formula expresses $I\left(p\right)$ as the product of two functions:
one of them, $I^{\left(0\right)}$, represents the effect of a single
period of the grating; the other, $H\left(N,x\right)$ has maxima,
each of height $N^{2}$ when\begin{equation}
p\equiv\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}=\frac{m\lambda}{Nd}\left(m=0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots\right),\label{eq:grating equation}\end{equation}


The integer $m$ represents, according to 7, the path difference in
wavelengths between light diffracted in the direction of the maximum,
from corresponding points in two neighboring grooves. In agreement
with our earlier definition,7.3.1, we call $m$ the \emph{order of
interference}. Between theses principal maxima there are weak secondary
maxima (see fig 8.19a), the first secondary maximum being only a few
percent of the principal maximum when $N$ is large. The maxima are
separated by points of zero intensity at $x=kdp/2=\pm n\pi/N$, i.e.
in directions given by\begin{equation}
p\equiv\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}=\frac{n\lambda}{Nd}\left(n=0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots\right)\label{eq: grating secondary maxima}\end{equation}


the case where $n/N$ is an integer being excluded.

The function $I^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)$ depends on the form
of the grooves. Suppose that it has principal maximum for some direction
$p=p'$ and that on both sides of the maximum if falls off slowly
in comparison with $H$. Then $I\left(p\right)$ will have the general
form o the sharp maxima near the directions $p=m\lambda/d$. Since
these directions (except for $m=0$) depend on the wavelength, we
see that the grating will decompose a beam of non-monochromatic light
into \emph{spectral orders}.

To illustrate these remarks let us consider a grating consisting of
a succession of long equidistant slits, each of width $s$ and length
$L$, in an opaque screen. If the grating is illuminated from a very
distant line source parallel to the slits, the intensity $I^{\left(0\right)}$
is given by the expression \ref{eq: diffraction envelope} (with $2a=s$,
$2b=L$) and we obtain\begin{equation}
I\left(p\right)=\frac{sE}{\lambda R^{2}}\left(\frac{\sin\frac{Nkdp}{2}}{\sin\frac{kdp}{2}}\right)^{2}\left(\frac{\sin\frac{kdp}{2}}{\frac{kdp}{2}}\right)^{2}.\label{eq: diffraction intensity}\end{equation}


Curves representing the two factors in \ref{eq: diffraction intensity}
and their product are shown in fig X. The last factor in \ref{eq: diffraction intensity},
which represents the effect of a single slit, has a principal maximum
at $p=0$ and minima given by $ksp/2=n\pi$, i.e. at\[
p=\frac{n\lambda}{s},\left(n=0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots\right)\]
 separated by weak secondary maxima. We see that if $\lambda/s\gg\lambda/d$,
i.e. if the width of each slit is small compared to $d$, the intensity
$I\left(p\right)$ has in addition to a principal maximum at $p=0$
a series of sharp, but progressively decreasing, maxima on either
side of it, near direction given by \ref{eq:grating equation}.

Returning to the general case, it is evident that if the width of
each groove is very small, of the order of a wavelength (as is often
the case in practice) the formula derived on the basis of Kirchhoff's
approximation, can evidently no longer be expected to hold. In such
cases more refined considerations must be make to determine the detailed
distribution of the intensity. We may, however, expect that the main
qualitative features indicated by our elementary theory, namely the
existence of sharp maxima whose positions are substantially determined
by the interference function $H$, remain even when the grooves are
very narrow, provided, that the intensity function of a single period
varies slowly in an interval of the order $\Delta p=\lambda/d$. Let
us now consider the resolution that may be attained with a grating.
The separation between a primary maximum of order $m$ and a neighbouring
minimum is, according to \ref{eq: grating secondary maxima}, given
by\[
\Delta p=\frac{\lambda}{Nd}.\]


If the wavelength is changed by an amount $\Delta\lambda$, the $m$th-order
maximum is according to \ref{eq:grating equation}, displaced by an
amount\[
\Delta'p=\frac{\left|m\right|}{d}\Delta\lambda.\]


Assuming that the lines of wavelength $\lambda\pm\frac{1}{2}\Delta\lambda$
will just be resolved when the maximum of the one wavelength coincides
with the first minimum of the other we have on he limit of resolution
in the $m$th order, $\Delta p=\Delta'p$, i.e.\begin{equation}
\frac{\lambda}{\Delta\lambda}=\left|m\right|N.\label{eq: resolving power}\end{equation}


Thus, \emph{the resolving power is equal to the product of the order
number m and the number N of the grooves}. For the $m$th order we
have, according to, that $d\left(\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}\right)=m\lambda$,
so that we may also express the resolving power in the form\[
\frac{\lambda}{\Delta\lambda}=\frac{Nd\left|\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}\right|}{\lambda}.\]


Because of \ref{eq: path difference} this implies that \emph{the
resolving power is equal to the number of wavelengths in the path
difference between rays that are diffracted in the direction $\theta$
from the two extreme ends (separated by distance Nd) of the grating}.
It is to be noted that since $\left|\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}\right|$
cannot exceed 2, the resolving power that can be attained with a grating
of overall with $w$ can never exceed the value $2w/\lambda$.


\subsection{Free spectral range}

From the resolving power equation \ref{eq: resolving power}, we conclude
that spectrometer should be operated on high diffraction order so
as to minimize the device size for a given resolution. Unfortunatelly,
the grating equation \ref{eq:grating equation}, $p\equiv\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}=\frac{m\lambda}{Nd}$,
we see that it is possible for light from to different wavelength
in differente diffraction orders to be diffracted to the same angle
$\theta$, sufficing that 

\[
m_{i}\lambda_{i}=m_{j}\lambda_{j}\]
for $i\neq j$, so for example light diffracted in order 1 at wavelength
1500 nm is diffracted in the same direction as light diffracted from
order 2 wavelength 750 nm. To avoid this ambiguity, it is of interest
to know when this condition happens. From the grating equation we
see that $p$ does not make sense outside the interval {[}0,1{]},
therefore, $0\le\frac{m\lambda_{m}}{Nd}\le1$ we then that for the
diffraction order $m$ the wavelength range that is going to be diffracted
is: \[
0\le\lambda_{m}\le\frac{Nd}{m}.\]
So for the first order the wavelength range that exists is every wavelength
below $Nd$ , for order 2 every wavelength below $Nd/2$ and so on.
We see then, that for order 1 the range $[Nd,Nd/2]$ is occupied solely
by order one. For order 2 the range $[Nd/2,Nd/3]$, for order $m$,
$[Nd/m,Nd/(m+1)]$. We see that the range width $\Delta\lambda_{m}$
which there is no overlaping diffraction, called \emph{free spectral
range}, can be computed as \[
\Delta\lambda_{m}=\frac{Nd}{m}-\frac{Nd}{m+1}=\frac{Nd}{m(m+1)},\]
we can replace the substitute the dependancy on $Nd$ for the wavelength
in the center of the free spectral range $\lambda_{Cm}$,

\[
\lambda_{Cm}=\frac{Nd}{m}-\frac{\Delta\lambda_{m}}{2}=\frac{Nd}{m(m+1)}(m+0.5),\]
It is worth noting that althought $\lambda_{Cm}$ is in the middle
of the spectral range $\Delta\lambda_{m}$ the wavelenths are not
linearly distributed along the angle range that it is diffracted to,
and therefore $\lambda_{Cm}$ is not located at the center of the
angle range of the $m$th order free spectral range. {[}Graph{]}We
see then that the free spectral range depends inverselly with the
diffraction order used, \begin{equation}
\Delta\lambda_{m}=\frac{\lambda_{Cm}}{m+0.5}.\label{eq:FSR}\end{equation}
This fact, ties to use the a maximum operating diffraction order to
the wavelength range and central wavelength we want the diffraction
grating to operate.


\section{Planar devices}

The previous exposition on diffraction grating does not change on
the medium in which the device is built on. But since we are interested
in spectrometeres integrated on chips, it worth lifting the characteristics
of this device. From this point two features stand out as very different
from regular free space spectrometer. First is that light is always
guided in a slab waveguide, the confinement of light in one dimension
change the nature of the system from a 3 dimensional to bi-dimensional
one. As this fact causes the light power to decay with the inverse
of the distance as it moves away from the source. The other diference
is the change of the dispersion due to both the material and the confinement
effect. The outcome of this is that for all the results in the previous
section, the wavelength variable that needs to be considered is the
effective wavelenght in the medium.\[
\lambda_{\text{eff}}=\frac{\lambda}{n_{\text{eff}}}\]



\section{Spectrometer Architectures}

Several architecture to build diffraction grating spectrometer exists.
Due to lowest size resolution of the Rowland design, it was chosen
to build the spectrometer. The Czerny-Turner is presented here to
introduce spectrometer because its design is easily understandable.
Arrayed waveguide grating has been the most used planar (on chip)
version of spectrometer. Marketed as wavelength de-multiplexer (WDM)
this layout is show because its role in the telecommunication industry
it is of interest to understand why it is not fit for role high resolution
on chip spectrometer.


\subsection{Czerny-Turner\label{sub:Czerny-Turner}}

Due to its modularity this architecture is probably the best to introduce
spectrometers. It is composed of two slits, two concave mirrors and
a diffraction grating. As shown in figure \ref{fig:Czerny-Turner-architecture},
the light to be analyzed is shined through the entrance slit. Due
to diffraction, the light fan out as it propagates to the collimating
concave mirror where light is collimated and reflected in the direction
of the diffraction grating. The diffraction grating then, deviates
light from each different wavelength (optical frequencies) into different
angles following the equation \ref{eq:grating equation}. A focusing
concave mirror focus the light coming from the diffraction grating
and deflect it to the detector slit.

%
\begin{figure}[h]


\center{\input{czerny-turner.pdf_tex}}\caption{Czerny-Turner \label{fig:Czerny-Turner-architecture}architecture}

\end{figure}


The function of the entrance slit is to filter spatial optical modes
that are inputed into the system. For best filtering the slit has
to transmit only a single spatial mode. This is achieved by making
the slit width of the order of the light wavelength. Decreasing slit
width will increase the beam spread angle, as depicted in figure \ref{fig:different slits},
for a chosen final beam width this will allow the collimating concave
mirror to placed nearer to the slit decreasing the device size. However,
decrease the slit width will also decrease the fraction of transmitted
light. and therefore, lowering the device sensitivity.

%
\begin{figure}[h]
\center{\input{slit_width.pdf_tex}}\caption{Different effects of slit width\label{fig:different slits}}



\end{figure}


As described by its name the collimating concave mirror collimates
the light coming from the entrance mirror and redirect it to the diffraction
grating. In order to \fnurl{collimate}{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collimated_light}
the input light, the curvature radius should be equal twice the distance
from the entrance slit to the center of the collimating concave mirror.
The mirror diameter must be bigger than the beam width at the when
it arrives at it to avoid losing light power.

The diffraction grating deviates light from each different wavelength
into different angles, as described by equation \ref{eq:grating equation}.
Details on how the light is diffracted are explained in section \ref{sec:Diffraction-grating}.
Roughly, the number of illuminated grooves, which is equal to the
beam diameter divided by the groove pitch, will determine the resolving
power of the spectrometer, as shown in equation \ref{eq: resolving power}.

To quantify the amount of light deviated to each different direction,
we use a focusing concave mirror, which will map light with different
direction and focus them each into a distinct point in a plane. Alternatively
we can say that light in different k in the k space into different
points in the coordinate space. Clearly, the size of the focusing
mirror must be such that it collects most of the light coming from
the diffraction grating. This means that it must be bigger than the
beam size plus account for the spread of different wavelengths.

A detector is placed at a point in the focus plan to measure the light
power. Optimum detector size is of the order of the entrance slit
width, limited also by the resolving power of the diffraction grating.
Placing a exit slit in the focus plane followed by a detector, can
be used as an alternative for the slit size detector.

%

\caption{Detector array and slit and detector options}

\end{figure}


Size analise


\subsection{Rowland\label{sub:Rowland}}

In year, Rowland \footcite{Rowland:1883p38} found a way to incorporate
the collimating and focusing elements into the diffraction grating.
This layout not only decreased the final device size, but also eliminate
spherical and astigmatism aberrations due to the auxiliary concave
mirrors.

The design consists in the use of a concave diffraction grating of
radius 2R. The entrance and exit slits positions are located in a
circle of radius R tangent to the diffraction grating sphere. Or more
precisely tangent to one of the equator of the diffraction grating
sphere. For optimum area usage, the equator should be perpendicular
to the diffraction grating grooves and passing through the grating
center.

%
\begin{figure}[h]
\center{\input{rowland-mounting.pdf_tex}}\caption{Rowland design.}

\end{figure}



\subsection{Arrayed Waveguide Grating (AWG)}

The resolving power of a diffraction grating is proportional to the
number of grooves and diffraction order, as shown in equation \ref{eq: resolving power}.
Diffraction grating based on ruled surfaces can not achieve diffraction
order greater than 20. Introduced by Takahashi et. al.\footcite{Takahashi:1990p122},
this limitation can be overcome by replacing the grating grooves by
an array of waveguides. To understand how the introduction of waveguide
help it is necessary to understand more generally what diffraction
order is. We say that certain diffraction peak is of order $m$ if
each wave from the set that was constructively interfered to form
the interference peak is delayed from one another of $m$ periods.
On traditional ruled surface diffraction gratings, wavefront from
different period are made to interfere by making the wave travel different
path lengths by taking path that deviates from the equal angle reflection.

%
\begin{figure}[h]
\center{\input{awg.pdf_tex}}\caption{Traditional diffraction grating generate different path length by
straying away from equal angle reflection.}

\end{figure}


By guiding light through waveguide it is possible to increase the
difference of path length among different waveguides, achieved by
only changing the waveguides lengths. Each waveguide of the waveguide
array would function like a groove in the diffraction grating, but
since waveguide length is only limited by its intrinsic loss, the
difference of path length can be on the order of hundreds of wavelength,
giving raise to grating that operate of diffraction order of also
hundreds.

Unfortunately there is a drawback of increasing diffraction order,
the free spectral range as described in \ref{eq:FSR}, decreases with
the inverse of the of the diffraction order. For instance, an arrayed
waveguide grating working on diffraction order 100 at wavelength 1500
nm would have a FSR of only 15 nm. Although this range is useful for
fiber optics telecommunications, this bandwidth is too small for most
spectroscopy application, optical coherence tomography or ultra-fast
oscilloscope{[}refs{]}. Since we want to achieve a wide spectrum range,
this architecture is not fit for us.


\section{Grating illuminated by a Gaussian Beam\label{sec:Grating gaussian beam}}

%
\begin{figure}[h]
\center{\input{gaussian-beam.pdf_tex}}\caption{Diffraction grating illuminated by a (a) uniform intensity beam, (b)
gaussian beam.\label{fig:square-gaussian}}



\end{figure}


On section \ref{sec:Diffraction-grating}, it was assumed that the
whole grating was uniformly illuminated. In practice, this case not
always occurs. Light source is normally a collimated light from a
slit, pin hole or fiber optics, where for best resolution, single
mode output should pass through. In those cases the tranversal power
profile is better modeled by a gaussian than by a square profile,
see figure \ref{fig:square-gaussian}. To ajust the resolving power
equation \ref{eq: resolving power} to account for the Gaussian profile
illumination we have to alter the squared illumination assumption
in equation \ref{eq: Up}. Using the relation we can equate \[
U\left(p\right)=U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\int\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\delta\left(x-n\right)\text{rect}\left[\frac{x}{2\left(N-1\right)}\right]e^{-ikxdp}dx\]
where\[
\text{rect}\left(x\right)=\begin{cases}
0 & \mbox{if }\left|x\right|>\frac{1}{2}\\
\frac{1}{2} & \mbox{if }\left|x\right|=\frac{1}{2}\\
1 & \mbox{if }\left|x\right|<\frac{1}{2}.\end{cases}\]
the rect$\left(x\right)$ function correspond to the squared illumination
assumption, for a Gaussian illumination we simply replace tha function
by a Gaussian function\[
\text{gauss}\mbox{\ensuremath{\left(x\right)}}=\exp\left[-4\ln2\left(\frac{x}{w/d}\right)^{2}\right]\]


where $d$ is the grating pitch, and $w$ is the Full Width at Half
Maximum field amplitude of the illuminating beam at the grating. Replacing
the Dirac delta comb by its Fourier series \[
\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}\delta\left(x-k\right)=\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}e^{i2\pi mx},\]
we get\[
U\left(p\right)=U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}\int\exp\left[-4\ln2\left(\frac{x}{w/d}\right)^{2}\right]e^{-i2\pi x\left(kdp/2\pi-m\right)}dx\]
performing the integral we obtain a comb of Gaussian \begin{equation}
U\left(p\right)=U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\frac{w}{\sqrt{2}}\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}\exp\left[-\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{kdp}{2\pi}-m\right)^{2}\frac{\left(w/d\right)^{2}}{4\ln2}\right],\label{eq:gaussian comb}\end{equation}
where each Gaussian is centered on the diffraction order $m$. From
it we get\begin{equation}
\frac{kdp}{2\pi}=m\mbox{ or }p=\frac{\lambda m}{d}.\label{eq:grating equation 2}\end{equation}
From equation \ref{eq:gaussian comb} we can define the wavelength
width $\Delta\lambda$ such that the power of wavelength $\lambda$
at diffraction order $m$, is halven as a been\[
\Delta p=2\ln2\frac{\lambda}{w},\]
or using the grating equation \ref{eq:grating equation 2} e define
the resolving power for a gaussian beam illuminated diffraction grating
as\begin{equation}
\frac{\lambda}{\Delta\lambda}=4\sqrt{2}\ln2\frac{wm}{d}\label{eq:resolving power gaussian}\end{equation}


It is worth noting that the relationship between the electric field
amplitude FWHM $w$ at the grating and the power FWHM $W$ is\[
W=\frac{w}{\sqrt{2}}\]


\[
\frac{\lambda}{\Delta\lambda}=8\ln2\frac{Wm}{d}\]



\section{Size}

For a given wavelength $\lambda$, resolution $\Delta\lambda$ and
free spectral range $\delta\lambda$, one would like to minimize the
device size. Since the device size is basically defined by the grating
size $W$. We have $W=a\frac{\lambda^{2}}{\Delta\lambda}$. Since
$Nm=\frac{\lambda}{\Delta\lambda}$. $W=a\frac{\lambda m}{\Delta\lambda}d$,
$\delta\lambda=\frac{\lambda}{m}$. $W=a\frac{\lambda^{2}}{\delta\lambda\Delta\lambda}d$$ $


\section{Spectral defects}


\subsection{Rowland Ghosts}

Rowland ghosts are spurious lines seen in some grating spectra that
result from periodic errors in the spacing of the grooves. These are
usually located symmetrically with respect to each strong spectral
line at a spectral distance from it, which depends on the period of
the error, and with an intensity that depends on the amplitude of
this error.


\subsection{Lyman Ghosts}


\section{Aberrations}

The resolving power equation \ref{eq: resolving power} states that
the resolution of a diffraction grating depends linearly with the
wavelength. Unfortunatelly, that relation is only valid for plane
waves. To use segregation capability of the diffraction grating, it
is necessary to have a source of plane waves and to measure the light
power that go to different direction after diffraction from the grating.
Sources and detector are space localized endpoints. But employing
lenses, it is possible to convert a space localized mode to a angle
localized mode., as discussed on the Czerny-Turner configuration in
section \ref{sub:Czerny-Turner}. This conversion, however, is not
perfect. In geometrical optics terms, this means that rays that enter
parallel in a lens (or any other focusin device) does no converge
to a single point after the lens and with the fase arriving at exaclty
the same time(picture?). Integrating the lens into the grating, as
done in Rowland configuration in section \ref{sub:Rowland}, does
not readily eliminate the problem, but its application together with
the potencial to fabricate designs with freedom to choose any geometry
and dispersion might be the solution.

First we will state formally what conditions need to be satified in
the design of a aberration free spectrometer. The non-existance of
a mathematical solution, lead us to show two corrections, named one
point and two point stigmatic correction, that reduce aberrations.


\subsection{Aberration free conditions}

One would like to design a perfect spectrometer free of aberration.
The ability of electron beam lithography to define with accuracy of
nanometers the position and shape of the grating grooves.

%
\begin{figure}
\center{\input{aberration-free.pdf_tex}}\caption{Diffraction grating spectrometer point problem sketch.\label{fig:aberration free}}



\end{figure}


The problem can be stated as follows: Light coming from a point $I$
fan out to a diffraction grating which the i-th groove, of $N$ grooves,
is located at $G_{i}$, at each groove light is reflected, fans out
again and propagates to a set of $M$ output waveguides which the
j-ith waveguide is located at $O_{j}$, as shown in figure \ref{fig:aberration free}.
To perfectly separate light from different wavelengths, we would like
that all light which has wavelength $\lambda_{j}$ coming from each
groove arrive in phase at the output point $O_{j}$. Furthermore,
we would like that light coming from each different groove have be
in a different cycle. The previeous conditions can be expressed by
a system of $N\times M$ nonlinear algebraic equations with the prototype

\begin{equation}
\overline{IG_{i}}+\overline{G_{i}O_{j}}=\lambda_{j}\left(a_{j}+mi\right)\text{ for }\left(i=1,2,\dots,N\right)\text{ and }\left(j=1,2,\dots,M\right),\label{eq:spectrometer equation}\end{equation}
where $m$ is an integer number which defines the diffraction order
and $a_{j}$ is a constant that states that the absolute path length
does not matter, only the path length difference between light coming
from different routes do. It is worth emphasizing that the path length
evaluation should consider the medium refractive index, from this
perspective one can interpret that light is also propagating in a
non-euclidean space.

For the case of a flat space in a plane, equation \ref{eq:spectrometer equation}
can be expanded to\begin{equation}
\sqrt{\left(I_{x}-G_{ix}\right)^{2}+\left(I_{y}-G_{iy}\right)^{2}}+\sqrt{\left(O_{jx}-G_{ix}\right)^{2}+\left(O_{jy}-G_{iy}\right)^{2}}=\lambda_{j}\left(a_{j}+mi\right)\text{ for }\left(i=1,2,\dots,N\right)\text{ and }\left(j=1,2,\dots,M\right),\label{eq:spectrometer equation expanded}\end{equation}
As discussed in sections \ref{sec:Diffraction-grating} and \ref{sec:Grating gaussian beam},
high resolution implies in the use of a high number of grooves $N$
 with numbers tipically achieving, thousands to millions. Number of
channels $M$ is, of course, as a wish of the costumer but numbers
around thousands are very typical. These implies that the set of equations
\ref{eq:spectrometer equation expanded} is comprised of $M\times N$
equations with and $2N+2C+1$ variables \[
\]


All equation

show that there is no build the full set of equations

footcite the papers that show it is not possible to solve for Euclidean
surface\footcite{Marz:1992p28,Beutler:1945p8,Namioka:1959p48,Velzel:1976p67},
but nothing has been shown for non-Euclidean surfaces. Fabrication
of non-Euclidean surfaces have been used to demonstrate cloaking devices\footcite{Gabrielli:2009p1173}.
Although it is not possible to find a solution for all equations,
solving for one and two points dramatically improves aberration.


\subsection{One point stigmatic correction}

In the modality a degree of freedom is left undefined leaving us the
possibility to choose the surface in which the diffraction grooves
are going to be positioned\footcite{McGreer:1996p15}. Using the Rowland
design as a basis, we show here how to place the grooves on a circle
in order to have a wavelength free of aberration.

\section{Blazing and Groove size}


\section{Rayleigh-Huygens model\label{sec:Rayleigh-Huygens-model}}

Numerical calculation where carried out using a Rayleigh-Huygens method adapted to a bidimensional world\footcite{Brouckaert:2007p82}. The implementation was done in a Python script program. And the program is available at \fnurl{Google Code}{http://code.google.com/p/khsimulator/}.  Roughly the Rayleigh method treat each part of the wavefornt as a directional source point towards the direction of th propagation of the wavefront at that point. The adaptation to bideretion field amplitude wll decais as $1/\sqrt{r}$ instead of $1/r$ in the tri-dimenasional case.

Figure \ref{fig:Huygens sketch} show a sketch of the geometry of the simulated grating. The simulation was carried in two steps. First the field in the grating groove were calculated assuming that the field in the input waveguide had a cossine mode line shape. Then, the field in the output waveguide dwas calculated using the field on the grating computed int eh previous step. The amaount of linght coupled in to the output waveugide was estimated by carring the inner prouct of the field in the output waveguide and the mode supported by that waveguide.

\end{figure}


According to the Kirchhoff-Huygens diffraction formula, the incident electric field $E_{\text{inc}}$ at the center points of the grating facets $\left(P'\right)$ at a distance $r_{1}$and at an angle $\alpha_{s}$
can be calculated as 
\[
E_{\text{inc}}=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{n_{\text{eff}}}{\lambda}}\int E_{\text{wg}}\left(y\right)\frac{e^{-jkr_{1}}}{\sqrt{r_{1}}}\left(1-\cos\alpha_{s}\right)dy\]


where $k=2\pi n_{\text{eff}}/\lambda$ is the wavenumber within the slab waveguide, and $E_{\text{wg}}$ is the electric field profile of the TE-polarized fundamental mode of the input waveguide. Similarly, the diffracted field $E_{\text{out}}$ on the collection wavguides is calculated as 

\[
E_{\text{out}}\left(P''\right)=\eta\sqrt{\frac{n_{\text{eff}}}{\lambda}}\sum_{\text{Grating}}\int_{-D/2}^{+D/2}E_{\text{inc}}\left(y\right)\frac{e^{-jkr_{2}}}{\sqrt{r_{2}}}\frac{\left(\cos\alpha_{i}-\cos\alpha_{d}\right)}{2}dy'\]

where $\alpha_{i}$ and $\alpha_{d}$ are the incident and diffracted angles with respect to the normal of each grating facet, and $\eta$ is the reflection coefficient of the grating. This formula is simplified if we assume that the magnitude of the incident field $\left|E_{\text{inc}}\right|$ is constant over each facet and the pahse of this field changes linearly along the length of the facet

\[
E_{\text{inc}}\left(y'\right)=E_{\text{inc}}\left(y'=0\right)e^{+iky'\sin\alpha_{i}}.\]


This aaproximation is valid if the sie of the facets is small compared with the distance to the input and if thangle of incidence $\alpha_{i}$ is small. This is thye case if the blaze point $\left(O\right)$ is positioned near the input waveguide $\left(I\right)$.

\footcite{Chowdhury:2000p56}

The integration of silicon photonics and electronics in a CMOS compatible platform enables whole monolithic device such as a wavelength division demultiplexer (WDM) integrated with detectors and electronic amplifiers.  Most silicon-on-insulator (SOI) WDMs with 1 nm channel spacing typically cover a spectral range of only 10 nm. The small spectral range in typical WDMs is due to the use of arrayed waveguide grating (AWG)\footcite{Nitkowski:2008p58,Ellis:2006p27} designs where large grating orders are employed to achieve small channel spacing which comes with the cost of free spectral range. It is possible to increase the spectral range by lowering the grating order and adding more waveguides to compensate, but this increases the overall chip size. Furthermore, due to the high index contrast of the silicon photonics platform, the achievable resolution depends on very fine control of the AWG waveguide dimensions. Here we demonstrate WDM using etched diffraction grating (EDG)\footcite{Kneipp:1999p20,MahadevanJansen:2010p89,Foster:2008p71}.

This design is more fabrication tolerant since light is propagating in a slab where the only dimension that needs to be controlled is the slab thickness. It is also more suitable to work at a low grating order because light diffracts in a single slab opposed to the two star couplers slabs in the AWG. 


\subsection{Design}

We designed a WDM that uses a Rowland design with one stigmatic point correction. The system was designed so that stigmatic point was located at the central waveguide of the 21 output waveguide array. The central wavelength was chosen to be 1500 nm and the diffraction order was 10. The Rowland circle was chosen to be 750 \textgreek{m}m. The designed grating contains 340 grooves. The resulting free spectral range was estimated to be 117 nm, and the groove spacing approximately 4 \textgreek{m}m. The input and output waveguide apertures were 1.4 \textgreek{m}m. A reference waveguide was placed next to the spectrometer so that the transmission efficiency could be estimated.


\subsection{Operating wavelength}

Due to the readly avaibility of testing equipment operating at 1460-1610 nm range we decided to design the system to operate somewhere at this range. Germanium detector have a peak detection at 1500 nm so we decided to design the spectrometer operating range centered at 1500 nm.


\subsection{Dispersion}

\end{figure}



\subsection{Grating size}
The spectrometer was patterned using a \fnurl{JEOL 9300FS}{http://www.jeol.com/PRODUCTS/SemiconductorEquipment/ElectronBeamLithography/JBX9300FS/tabid/152/Default.aspx} electron beam lithographer. The system is capable of writing using only beam deflecton on an area (denominated \emph{field size}) of 1x1 mm. By moving the sample to be written (process called as \emph{stitching}) one is capable of writing a whole 5x5 inches mask. Unfortunatelly
due to the extreme precision required, it is difficult to align the boders of neighboring fields perfectly, with the system working its best alignments of 10 nm are possible, though achieving this kind of precision is requires a good amount of trials and experience, alignments of 50 nm are more routinelly achieved. In order to avoid errors in the spectrometer grating during stitching we limited the size of the grating in order of it to fit in a single 1x1 mm field, which meant placing the grating along the diagonal of the field, which, ignoring the grating curvature, gaves us a grating size of 1.4 mm.


\subsection{Diffraction order and input, output angles}

As stated on section \ref{eq:resolving power gaussian} a higher resolving power can be achieved due to arguments to be described at X we limited our operating range to 150 nm, this would allow us to operate at diffraction order -10 or 10. 

According to the grating equation 


\subsection{Number of grooves}

The higher the number of grooves the higher resolving power we can get. But since we want to limit the grating size, in this particular device to 1.4 mm. Increasing the number of grooves also means decreaing pitch size and increase of diffraction angle, as shown in graph X. 


\subsection{Linear Dipersion}

angular dispersion is\[
\theta_{\text{out}}=\arcsin\left(m\frac{\lambda}{a}+\sin\theta_{\text{in}}\right)\]


angular dispersion is

\[
\delta\theta_{\text{out}}=\frac{\partial\theta_{\text{out}}}{\partial\lambda}\delta\lambda=\frac{m\delta\lambda}{a\left[1+\left(m\frac{\lambda}{a}+\sin\theta_{\text{in}}\right)^{2}\right]}\]


Linear dispersion 

\[
LD=\frac{R}{2}\left(2\delta\theta_{\text{out}}\right)=\frac{Rm\delta\lambda}{a\left[1+\left(m\frac{\lambda}{a}+\sin\theta_{\text{in}}\right)^{2}\right]}\]

We design the DG spectrometer using the Rowland architecture. To reduce spherical aberration, a non-uniform groove spacing is employed\footcite{McGreer:1996p15}. Metal heaters are added above the silicon layer \footcite{SherwoodDroz:2008p57} to align the resonator and spectrometer transmission combs using the thermo-optic effect in silicon. The diffraction grating spectrometer contains 25 channels with spacing of 1 nm. To match the ring resonator FSR to the DG spectrometer channel spacing we use an 83.5 m radius ring with waveguide cross-section of 450 x 250 nm. The FSR changes with wavelength according to $2\lambda/(n_{g}L)$, but considering a slight positive group velocity dispersion ($\partial n_{g}/\partial\lambda\approx3.6\times10^{-3}\text{nm}^{-1}$) this change is extremely small: the total change in FSR across the range of operation (25 nm) is approximately 1\% for light polarized in the plane of the device (TE polarization).

Output posistioning


\subsection{Output waveguide positioning}

For better accuracy on spectrometer channels output wavelengths. Each channel was positioned not accordingly to equation \ref{eq:grating equation} but by maximizing the output transmission depending on the output waveguide position, where the transmission was calculated numerically.  Deviation from the grating equation result are attributed to the non-uniformity of grating grooves distribuition.


\subsection{Fabrication}

We fabricated the device using CMOS compatible procedures. First, we start with an SOI wafer with 250 nm silicon and 3 \textgreek{m}m buried oxide. An 80 nm layer of SiO2 was deposited using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) to be used as a hard mask. A 200 nm layer of PMMA was spun and then the grating and the waveguides were defined using e-beam lithography. The pattern was transferred from PMMA the to the oxide layer using CHF3/O2 reactive ion etch.  The silicon layer was etched using Cl2 inductively coupled plasmaand then 2.3 \textgreek{m}m of SiO2 was deposited using PECVD to clad the device. The wafer was diced and polished for optical testing.


\subsection{Testing}

%
\begin{figure}[h]
\center{\input{setup.pdf_tex}}\caption{Experimental setup used to test the on chip spectrometer.\label{fig:setup photograph}}
\end{figure}


We measured the performance of our WDM and observed -10 dB crosstalk and 1 nm channel spacing across 21 channels. As shown in Fig. 2, a relatively flat transmission spectrum was obtained. This result was measured by inserting light from a tunable laser and measuring the power from the output waveguides. A fiber polarization controller was used to set the input polarization to TE and a polarizer was placed between the chip output and the detector to filter out any TM polarized light. An insertion loss of -10 dB was estimated by comparing to the transmission through the reference waveguide. This can be attributed to Fresnel reflection between the Si-SiO2 interfaces at the grating groove facet and can be reduced by coating the grating facets with a reflective metal.

%
\begin{figure}[h]
\center{\input{setup1.pdf_tex}}\caption{Schemtics of the setup used to test the on chip spectrometer.\label{fig:setup schematics}}
\end{figure}


In conclusion, we demonstrate a one point stigmatic Rowland grating WDM with 21 channels, 1 nm channel spacing and better than -10 dB crosstalk. Since the free spectral range is greater the 100 nm, by adding additional output waveguides it is possible to construct a WDM that covers whole C-band.%

How can we use resonators to make spectrometer. An array of resonators can be used. But fabrication limits prevent its use without requiring individually tuning each resonator. Grating spectrometers uses a lot of space. Is there a middle way. Yes! we can use small free spectral range resonators and a grating spectrometer. The device described in this chapter was published on optics express and presented on the Conference of Lasers and Electro-Optics 2010 (CLEO) as a invited paper and received and honorable mention in the Maiman Student Paper Competition.


\section{Device Theory}

The principle of operation consists of using a resonator to pre-filter the light to be analyzed by a diffraction grating spectrometer as shown in figure \ref{Fig:resonator-enhanced-principle}. The resonator transmits only the resonant wavelengths. A diffraction grating spectrometer is then used to route light from different resonances into distinct output channels. The net effect is that the final resonator and diffraction grating spectrometer line width will be equal to the resonator line width. On silicon ring resonators cladded with silicon dioxide, line width as narrow as 30 pm are routinely achieved{[}ref{]}. Therefore, enabling the possibility of creating 30 pm resolution spectrometers. To achieve this, the resonator and the spectrometer must be designed so that the channel spacing of the diffraction grating spectrometer matches the ring resonator FSR.

The spectrometer must be designed so that each output channel only allows to transmit a single resonance. Therefore the spectrometer channel spacing must be equal to the resonator FSR.

The spectral resolution of the composed resonator and spectrometer can be estimated as follows. 
 
The transmission spectrum of the composed resonator and spectrometer is the product of the resonator and spectrometer transmission spectrum, as shown in figure \ref{Fig:combination-spectrum-demo}.a.

In the described configuration 


\subsection{Crosstalk}


\section{Design}

For DG spectrometer the same design as in section \ref{sec:implementation} was used. A ring resonator with a drop port was designed to have 1 nm FSR in order to match the DG spectroemter channel spacing. Metal heaters are added above the silicon layer to align the resonator and spectrometer transmission combs using the thermo-optic effect in silicon.  The diffraction grating spectrometer contains 25 channels. To match the ring resonator FSR to the DG spectrometer channel spacing we use an 83.5 \textgreek{m}m radius ring with waveguide cross-section of 450 x 250 nm. The FSR changes with wavelength according to $2\lambda/n_{g}L$, but considering a slight positive group velocity dispersion ($\partial n_{g}/\partial\lambda\approx3.6\times10^{-3}\text{nm}^{-1}$) this change is extremely small: the total change in FSR across the range of operation (25 nm) is approximately 1\% for light polarized in the plane of the device (TE polarization).


\section{Fabrication}

The fabrication was done in the \fnurl{Cornell Nanoscale Facility (CNF)}{http://www.cnf.cornell.edu}. A research micro-fabrication laboratory, funded in part by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and by its users. The research facility counts with state of the art electron beam lithography writer.

We fabricate the device using a CMOS compatible process. We start with a silicon-on-insulator (SOI), manufactured by \fnurl{Soitec}{(http://www.soitec.com)} wafer with a 250 nm top silicon layer and a 3 \textgreek{m}m buried oxide layer. A 60 nm layer of SiO$_{2}$ is deposited using high-temperature low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (HTO) to be used as a hard mask. The grating, ring and waveguides are defined by e-beam lithography on a PMMA resist mask. The pattern is transferred to the oxide layer using a CHF$_{3}$/O$_{2}$ reactive ion etch (RIE). The silicon layer is etched using chlorine RIE. A layer of 160 nm of SiO$_{2}$ is deposited using HTO to conformally fill the 100 nm gaps in the waveguide to ring coupling, then 1 \textgreek{m}m of SiO$_{2}$ is deposited using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition to clad the device. We define the heaters using photolithography (using SPR955CM and LOR5A resists) and then deposit a NiCr film. After lift-off, t plahe wafer is diced and polished for optical testing.

\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/fab-1}\caption{}
\end{figure}



\section{Testing}

We measure the device transmission spectrum by coupling laser light from a tunable laser into the input waveguide using a lensed fiber and measuring the transmitted power as a function of wavelength. The input light is TE polarized and the output light is collected using a microscope objective and filtered for the TE polarization before
detection. We achieve a channel FWHM of 0.05 nm across 10 different channels of the composed ring and EDG spectrometer, which represents a decrease in the channel width by 10 times compared with the DG spectrometer alone. This channel width corresponds to a quality factor of $Q=\lambda/\Delta\lambda=30000$.

Figure 3(b) shows the device transmission. The transmission is normalized to the ring through port power level to eliminate coupling losses.  The device insertion loss varies between -18 and -23 dB, where -10 dB is due to the Fresnel reflection of the diffraction grating and can be eliminated by coating it with a metal or using Bragg reflectors \footcite{Brouckaert:2008p108}. Other losses are attributed to stitching in the waveguide definition during e-beam lithography. A small mismatch between the resonator FSR (0.97 nm) and the DG spectrometer channel spacing (1 nm) cause a misalignment between the resonance and the DG spectrometer channel that builds up from one channel to the next in a Vernier effect. The outcome is a misalignment between the 11th spectrometer channel and the 11th ring resonance. Therefore only 10 of the 25 channels on the DG spectrometer are used. This issue can be eliminated by more detailed characterization of fabrication.%

\section{Increasing Channel Density}

change of refractive index with temperature

Ring tunning calibration

- ring tuning

-spectrometer tuning

Serializing devices either spatially or in time can increase the spectrometer channel density. The space serialization approach consists of using multiple combined ring-DG spectrometers, so that the input of a spectrometer is connected to the through port of the previous device, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The peak wavelength of each spectrometer is shifted relative to the others. The number of devices needed in order to achieve the a spectral density where the channels are separated by $\Delta\lambda_{FWHM}$, is equal to the DG spectrometer channel width divided by $\Delta\lambda_{FWHM}$.  In spite of the area increase, this approach is still more compact than using a traditional diffraction grating spectrometer since in this proposed approach the area increases linearly with resolution as opposed to quadratic in traditional DGs.

In time serialization, Fig. 4(b), only a single combined spectrometer is used and the output spectrum is measured several times. In each measurement the device transmission spectrum is shifted. Notice that this approach also requires active tuning of the ring and the EDG spectrometer. By applying the time serialization technique we were able to reduce the channel spacing from 0.97 nm to 0.097 nm, and were able to measure 100 channels using the device.

A zoom in on the series of channels is depicted in Fig. 6 (a). Figure 6 (b) shows a density plot where each horizontal line corresponds to the transmission spectrum of each channel. Notice that the overlap of the residual transmission from the DG spectrometer with the neighboring resonances can be seen in the side diagonal lines, and their transmissions are at least 10 dB lower than the peak (main diagonal line).

\section{Device Comparison}


\section{Effect of transmission spectrum lineshape}

The effect that the transmission lineshape causes on the output spectrum is that the final measured spectrum is the convolution of the real spectrum with the channel transmission spectrum. The basic consquence is the limitation of the spectroemter resolution. For systems where the desired data is the Fourier transform of the output, such as optical coherence tomography and ultra fast osciloscope, the transmission spectrum linshape will cause a roll of as the frequency increases in the Fourier transmorm graph. This is due to the \fnurl{convolution theorem}{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem} that states that the Fourier transform of a convolution is the pointwise
product of Fourier transforms of the convoluted functions.

If the aperture $\mathbb{Q}$ is much smaller than $r$, then we can
consider that $\cos\left(r,m\right)$ does not vary a lot in the integral,
therefore we can pull it outside the integral, which convert the integral
to $U\left(P\right)$. We therefore can simplify the equations to\[
\begin{cases}
U\left(P\right)=\int_{\mathbb{Q}}\frac{e^{\text{i}kr}}{\sqrt{kr}}\left[\frac{ikU\left(Q\right)}{2}\cos\left(r,n\right)-\frac{\partial U\left(Q\right)}{\partial n}\right]dS\\

We can enclose $\mathbb{Q}$ by a circule of radius $q$ centered

where $\left|v\right|<q$. And we define $\vec{r}'=P-Q_{C}$\[
\]


\[
\cos\left(r,m\right)=\frac{\vec{r}\cdot\hat{m}}{r}=\frac{\left(P-Q\right)\cdot\hat{m}}{\left|P-Q\right|}\]

\[
\left|\vec{r'}-\vec{v}\right|=\sqrt{r'^{2}+v^{2}+r'v\cos\left(r,v\right)}=r'\sqrt{1+\frac{v^{2}}{r'^{2}}+\frac{v}{r'}\cos\left(r,v\right)}\]
\[
\cos\left(r,m\right)=\frac{\cos\left(r',m\right)}{\sqrt{1+\frac{v^{2}}{r'^{2}}+\frac{v}{r'}\cos\left(r,v\right)}}-\frac{v}{r'}\frac{\cos\left(v,m\right)}{\sqrt{1+\frac{v^{2}}{r'^{2}}+\frac{v}{r'}\cos\left(r,v\right)}}\]
since $v<q\ll r'$, then at first approximation $\cos\left(r,m\right)=\cos\left(r',m\right)+O\left(\frac{q}{r'}\right)$
