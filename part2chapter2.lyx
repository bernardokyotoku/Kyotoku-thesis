It is difficult to enumerate all the contribuition to society that diffraction
 grating has brought.
 Its role on identifying the discrete energy levels of atoms provided a
 significant amount of information to the development of quantum mechanics.

A diffraction grating may be defined as any arrangement which imposes on
 an incident wave a periodic variation of amplitude of phase, or both.
 We may characterize any particular grating by its 
\emph on

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, defined as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let a transparent or semitransparent object (not necessarily periodic) cover
 a portion of a fictitious reference plane 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi\eta$
\end_inset

, and let it be illuminated by a plane monochromatic wave incident in a
 direction specified by the direction cosines 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Fig illustrates the arrangement, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

-axis being perpendicular to the plane of he drawing.
 If no object were present, the disturbance in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi,\eta$
\end_inset

-plane would be represented by the function 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}\left(\xi,\eta\right)=A\exp\left[ik\left(l_{0}\xi+m_{0}\eta\right)\right]$
\end_inset

, the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp\left(-i\omega t\right)$
\end_inset

 being, as usual, omitted.
 Because of the presence of the object disturbance will be modified and
 may be represented by some other function, which we denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $V\left(\xi,\eta\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\emph on
transmission function
\emph default
 of the object is then defined as
\begin_inset Formula \[
F\left(\xi,\eta\right)=\frac{V\left(\xi,\eta\right)}{V_{0}\left(\xi,\eta\right)}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 depends, not only on 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 but also on the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(l_{0},m_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

 of illumination.
 The transmission function is in general complex, since both the amplitude
 and the phase of the light may be altered on the passing through the object.
 In the special case when the object alters the amplitude but no the phase
 of the incident wave (i.e.
 if arg 
\begin_inset Formula $F\equiv0$
\end_inset

), we speak of an 
\emph on
amplitude object
\emph default
; if it alters the phase but not the amplitude (i.
 e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|F\right|=1$
\end_inset

) we speak of a 
\emph on
phase object
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we are concerned with reflected light rather than with light that is
 transmitted by an object, it is more appropriate to speak of a 
\emph on
reflection function
\emph default
, defined in a similar way, the only difference being that the reference
 plane is on the same side of the object as the incident light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|V/V_{0}\right|$
\end_inset

 is practically unity for points outside the geometrical shadow (whose boundary
 is represented by points A and B in Figure) cast by the object.
 If the portion outside the shadow region is covered by an opaque screen,
 the arrangements act as a diffracting aperture A with a nonuniform pupil
 function.

If the linear dimensions of A are large compared to the wavelength and if
 F remains sensibly constant over regions whose dimensions are of the same

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now consider a one-dimensional grating consisting of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 parallel grooves of arbitrary profile, ruled on one surface of a plan-parallel
 glass plate.
 Let the 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi,\eta$
\end_inset

-plane coincide with the plane face of the plate, 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 being the direction of the grooves and let 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 be the period in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume that the direction of propagation of the wave incident upon the grating
 is in the plane of the figure, making an angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $O\zeta$
\end_inset

, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 denote the angle which 
\begin_inset Formula $O\zeta$
\end_inset

 makes with the line joining a very distant point of observation P with
 the grating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As before we set 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{o}=\sin\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $l=\sin\theta$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p=l-l_{0}=\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 The complex amplitude at 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is then immediately obtained from, where the integrand must be multiplied
 by the transmission function 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 of one periodic element.
 We may set 
\begin_inset Formula $q=0$
\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset Formula \[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\xi_{n}=nd, & \eta_{n}=0 & \left(n=0,1,\ldots,N-1\right)\end{array}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We the obtain
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
U\left(p\right)=U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}e^{-ikndp}=U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\frac{1-e^{-iNkdp}}{1-e^{-kdp}},\label{eq: Up}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)=C\int_{A}\! F\left(\xi\right)e^{-ikp\xi}\, d\xi.\label{eq: diffraction envelope}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence
\begin_inset Formula \[
I\left(p\right)=\left|U\left(p\right)\right|^{2}=\frac{\left(1-e^{-Nkdp}\right)}{\left(1-e^{-kdp}\right)}\cdot\frac{\left(1-e^{Nkdp}\right)}{\left(1-e^{kdp}\right)}\left|U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\right|^{2}=\frac{1-\cos Nkdp}{1-\cos kdp}I^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right),\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $I^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)=\left|U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 If we introduce the function
\begin_inset Formula \[
H\left(N,x\right)=\left(\frac{\sin Nx}{\sin x}\right)^{2},\]

\end_inset

 the formula 5 for the intensity may be written as
\begin_inset Formula \[
I\left(p\right)=H\left(N,\frac{kdp}{2}\right)I^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right).\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before discussing the implications of this basic formula we note that according
 to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: Up"

\end_inset

.
 The light distribution is the same as that due to a set of coherent secondary
 sources each characterized by the same amplitude function 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\right|$
\end_inset

 and with phases that differ form each other by integral multiples of 
\begin_inset Formula $kdp$
\end_inset

.
 To see the significance of this phase difference consider two corresponding
 points 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in the neighboring grooves of the grating.
 Since the effect of the grating is to impress a periodic variation onto
 the incident wave, it follows that the path difference between the light
 arriving a 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and at 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is the same as in the absence of the grating, i.e.
 it is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $AK=d\sin\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 denoting the foot of the perpendicular from 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 on to the ray incident at 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Further, the light path from 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 exceeds the light path from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $BL=d\sin\theta$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 being the foot of the perpendicular from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 on to the ray diffracted at 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta.$
\end_inset

 Hence the total path difference between light arriving at the distant point
 of observation form corresponding points in two neighboring grooves is
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
BL-AK=d\left(\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}\right)=dp,\label{eq: path difference}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and the corresponding phase difference is 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi dp/\lambda=kdp$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Formula expresses 
\begin_inset Formula $I\left(p\right)$
\end_inset

 as the product of two functions: one of them, 
\begin_inset Formula $I^{\left(0\right)}$
\end_inset

, represents the effect of a single period of the grating; the other, 
\begin_inset Formula $H\left(N,x\right)$
\end_inset

 has maxima, each of height 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{2}$
\end_inset

 when
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
p\equiv\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}=\frac{m\lambda}{Nd}\left(m=0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots\right),\label{eq:grating equation}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The integer 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 represents, according to 7, the path difference in wavelengths between
 light diffracted in the direction of the maximum, from corresponding points
 in two neighboring grooves.
 In agreement with our earlier definition,7.3.1, we call 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 the 
\emph on
order of interference
\emph default
.
 Between theses principal maxima there are weak secondary maxima (see fig
 8.19a), the first secondary maximum being only a few percent of the principal
 maximum when 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is large.
 The maxima are separated by points of zero intensity at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=kdp/2=\pm n\pi/N$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 in directions given by
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
p\equiv\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}=\frac{n\lambda}{Nd}\left(n=0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots\right)\label{eq: grating secondary maxima}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $n/N$
\end_inset

 is an integer being excluded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The function 
\begin_inset Formula $I^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)$
\end_inset

 depends on the form of the grooves.
 Suppose that it has principal maximum for some direction 
\begin_inset Formula $p=p'$
\end_inset

 and that on both sides of the maximum if falls off slowly in comparison
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $I\left(p\right)$
\end_inset

 will have the general form o the sharp maxima near the directions 
\begin_inset Formula $p=m\lambda/d$
\end_inset

.
 Since these directions (except for 
\begin_inset Formula $m=0$
\end_inset

) depend on the wavelength, we see that the grating will decompose a beam
 of non-monochromatic light into 
\emph on
spectral orders
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate these remarks let us consider a grating consisting of a succession
 of long equidistant slits, each of width 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 and length 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

, in an opaque screen.
 If the grating is illuminated from a very distant line source parallel
 to the slits, the intensity 
\begin_inset Formula $I^{\left(0\right)}$
\end_inset

 is given by the expression 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: diffraction envelope"

\end_inset

 (with 
\begin_inset Formula $2a=s$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $2b=L$
\end_inset

) and we obtain
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
I\left(p\right)=\frac{sE}{\lambda R^{2}}\left(\frac{\sin\frac{Nkdp}{2}}{\sin\frac{kdp}{2}}\right)^{2}\left(\frac{\sin\frac{kdp}{2}}{\frac{kdp}{2}}\right)^{2}.\label{eq: diffraction intensity}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Curves representing the two factors in

 The last factor in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: diffraction intensity"

\end_inset

, which represents the effect of a single slit, has a principal maximum
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0$
\end_inset

 and minima given by 
\begin_inset Formula $ksp/2=n\pi$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 at
\begin_inset Formula \[
p=\frac{n\lambda}{s},\left(n=0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots\right)\]

\end_inset

 separated by weak secondary maxima.
 We see that if 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda/s\gg\lambda/d$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 if the width of each slit is small compared to 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, the intensity 
\begin_inset Formula $I\left(p\right)$
\end_inset

 has in addition to a principal maximum at 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0$
\end_inset

 a series of sharp, but progressively decreasing, maxima on either side
 of it, near direction given by 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:grating equation"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Returning to the general case, it is evident that if the width of each groove
 is very small, of the order of a wavelength (as is often the case in practice)
 the formula derived on the basis of Kirchhoff's approximation, can evidently
 no longer be expected to hold.
 In such cases more refined considerations must be make to determine the
 detailed distribution of the intensity.
 We may, however, expect that the main qualitative features indicated by
 our elementary theory, namely the existence of sharp maxima whose positions
 are substantially determined by the interference function 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

, remain even when the grooves are very narrow, provided, that the intensity
 function of a single period varies slowly in an interval of the order 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p=\lambda/d$
\end_inset

.
 Let us now consider the resolution that may be attained with a grating.
 The separation between a primary maximum of order 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and a neighbouring minimum is, according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: grating secondary maxima"

\end_inset

, given by
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Delta p=\frac{\lambda}{Nd}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the wavelength is changed by an amount 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\lambda$
\end_inset

, the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

th-order maximum is according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:grating equation"

\end_inset

, displaced by an amount
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Delta'p=\frac{\left|m\right|}{d}\Delta\lambda.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that the lines of wavelength 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\pm\frac{1}{2}\Delta\lambda$
\end_inset

 will just be resolved when the maximum of the one wavelength coincides
 with the first minimum of the other we have on he limit of resolution in
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

th order, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p=\Delta'p$
\end_inset

, i.e.
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{\lambda}{\Delta\lambda}=\left|m\right|N.\label{eq: resolving power}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, 
\emph on
the resolving power is equal to the product of the order number m and the
 number N of the grooves
\emph default
.
 For the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

th order we have, according to, that 
\begin_inset Formula $d\left(\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}\right)=m\lambda$
\end_inset

, so that we may also express the resolving power in the form
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\lambda}{\Delta\lambda}=\frac{Nd\left|\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}\right|}{\lambda}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: path difference"

\end_inset

 this implies that 
\emph on
the resolving power is equal to the number of wavelengths in the path difference
 between rays that are diffracted in the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 from the two extreme ends (separated by distance Nd) of the grating
\emph default
.
 It is to be noted that since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}\right|$
\end_inset

 cannot exceed 2, the resolving power that can be attained with a grating
 of overall with 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 can never exceed the value 
\begin_inset Formula $2w/\lambda$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Free spectral range
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the resolving power equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: resolving power"

\end_inset

, we conclude that spectrometer should be operated on high diffraction order
 so as to minimize the device size for a given resolution.
 Unfortunatelly, the grating equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:grating equation"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p\equiv\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}=\frac{m\lambda}{Nd}$
\end_inset

, we see that it is possible for light from to different wavelength in different
e diffraction orders to be diffracted to the same angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

, sufficing that 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
m_{i}\lambda_{i}=m_{j}\lambda_{j}\]

\end_inset

for 
\begin_inset Formula $i\neq j$
\end_inset

, so for example light diffracted in order 1 at wavelength 1500 nm is diffracted
 in the same direction as light diffracted from order 2 wavelength 750 nm.
 To avoid this ambiguity, it is of interest to know when this condition
 happens.
 From the grating equation we see that 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 does not make sense outside the interval [0,1], therefore,

\begin_inset Formula $0\le\frac{m\lambda_{m}}{Nd}\le1$

\begin_inset Formula \[

 below 
\begin_inset Formula $Nd$
\end_inset

 , for order 2 every wavelength below 
\begin_inset Formula $Nd/2$
\end_inset

 and so on.
 We see then, that for order 1 the range 
\begin_inset Formula $[Nd,Nd/2]$
\end_inset

 For order 2 the range 
\begin_inset Formula $[Nd/2,Nd/3]$
\end_inset

, for order 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

It is worth noting that althought

 is in the middle of the spectral range 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\lambda_{m}$

 the wavelenths are not linearly distributed along the angle range that

 is not located at the center of the angle range of the

 [Graph]We see then that the free spectral range depends inverselly with
 the diffraction order used, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}

\begin_layout Standard
The previous exposition on diffraction grating does not change on the medium
 in which the device is built on.
 But since we are interested in spectrometeres integrated on chips, it worth
 lifting the characteristics of this device.
 From this point two features stand out as very different from regular free
 space spectrometer.
 First is that light is always guided in a slab waveguide, the confinement
 of light in one dimension change the nature of the system from a 3 dimensional
 to bi-dimensional one.
 As this fact causes the light power to decay with the inverse of the distance
 as it moves away from the source.
 The other diference is the change of the dispersion due to both the material
 and the confinement effect.
 The outcome of this is that for all the results in the previous section,
 the wavelength variable that needs to be considered is the effective wavelenght
 in the medium.
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lambda_{\text{eff}}=\frac{\lambda}{n_{\text{eff}}}\]

Spectrometer Architectures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several architecture to build diffraction grating spectrometer exists.
 Due to lowest size resolution of the Rowland design, it was chosen to build
 the spectrometer.
 The Czerny-Turner is presented here to introduce spectrometer because its
 design is easily understandable.
 Arrayed waveguide grating has been the most used planar (on chip) version
 of spectrometer.
 Marketed as wavelength de-multiplexer (WDM) this layout is show because
 its role in the telecommunication industry it is of interest to understand
 why it is not fit for role high resolution on chip spectrometer.

Due to its modularity this architecture is probably the best to introduce
 spectrometers.
 It is composed of two slits, two concave mirrors and a diffraction grating.
 As shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Czerny-Turner-architecture"

\end_inset

, the light to be analyzed is shined through the entrance slit.
 Due to diffraction, the light fan out as it propagates to the collimating
 concave mirror where light is collimated and reflected in the direction
 of the diffraction grating.
 The diffraction grating then, deviates light from each different wavelength
 (optical frequencies) into different angles following the equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 A focusing concave mirror focus the light coming from the diffraction grating
 and deflect it to the detector slit.

The function of the entrance slit is to filter spatial optical modes that
 are inputed into the system.
 For best filtering the slit has to transmit only a single spatial mode.
 This is achieved by making the slit width of the order of the light wavelength.
 Decreasing slit width will increase the beam spread angle, as depicted
 in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:different slits"

\end_inset

, for a chosen final beam width this will allow the collimating concave
 mirror to placed nearer to the slit decreasing the device size.
 However, decrease the slit width will also decrease the fraction of transmitted
 light.
 and therefore, lowering the device sensitivity.

 Roughly, the number of illuminated grooves, which is equal to the beam

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To quantify the amount of light deviated to each different direction, we
 use a focusing concave mirror, which will map light with different direction
 and focus them each into a distinct point in a plane.
 Alternatively we can say that light in different k in the k space into
 different points in the coordinate space.
 Clearly, the size of the focusing mirror must be such that it collects
 most of the light coming from the diffraction grating.
 This means that it must be bigger than the beam size plus account for the
 spread of different wavelengths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A detector is placed at a point in the focus plan to measure the light power.
 Optimum detector size is of the order of the entrance slit width, limited
 also by the resolving power of the diffraction grating.
 Placing a exit slit in the focus plane followed by a detector, can be used
 as an alternative for the slit size detector.

 The entrance and exit slits positions are located in a circle of radius

 sphere.
 For optimum area usage, the equator should be perpendicular to the diffraction

, this limitation can be overcome by replacing the grating grooves by an
 array of waveguides.
 To understand how the introduction of waveguide help it is necessary to
 understand more generally what diffraction order is.
 We say that certain diffraction peak is of order 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 if each wave from the set that was constructively interfered to form the
 interference peak is delayed from one another of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 On traditional ruled surface diffraction gratings, wavefront from different
 period are made to interfere by making the wave travel different path lengths
 by taking path that deviates from the equal angle reflection.

\begin_layout Standard
By guiding light through waveguide it is possible to increase the difference
 of path length among different waveguides, achieved by only changing the
 waveguides lengths.
 Each waveguide of the waveguide array would function like a groove in the
 diffraction grating, but since waveguide length is only limited by its
 intrinsic loss, the difference of path length can be on the order of hundreds
 of wavelength, giving raise to grating that operate of diffraction order
 of also hundreds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately there is a drawback of increasing diffraction order, the free
 spectral range as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:FSR"

\end_inset

, decreases with the inverse of the of the diffraction order.
 For instance, an arrayed waveguide grating working on diffraction order
 100 at wavelength 1500 nm would have a FSR of only 15 nm.
 Although this range is useful for fiber optics telecommunications, this
 bandwidth is too small for most spectroscopy application, optical coherence
 tomography or ultra-fast oscilloscope[refs].
 Since we want to achieve a wide spectrum range, this architecture is not
 fit for us.

On section

, it was assumed that the whole grating was uniformly illuminated.
 In practice, this case not always occurs.
 Light source is normally a collimated light from a slit, pin hole or fiber
 optics, where for best resolution, single mode output should pass through.
 In those cases the tranversal power profile is better modeled by a gaussian
 than by a square profile, see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 To ajust the resolving power equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 to account for the Gaussian profile illumination we have to alter the squared
 illumination assumption in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula \[
U\left(p\right)=U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\int\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\delta\left(x-n\right)\text{rect}\left[\frac{x}{2\left(N-1\right)}\right]e^{-ikxdp}dx\]

the rect
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x\right)$

performing the integral we obtain a comb of Gaussian 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
U\left(p\right)=U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\frac{w}{\sqrt{2}}\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}\exp\left[-\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{kdp}{2\pi}-m\right)^{2}\frac{\left(w/d\right)^{2}}{4\ln2}\right],\label{eq:gaussian comb}\end{equation}

Rowland ghosts are spurious lines seen in some grating spectra that result
 from periodic errors in the spacing of the grooves.

\begin_layout Standard
The resolving power equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 states that the resolution of a diffraction grating depends linearly with
 the wavelength.
 Unfortunatelly, that relation is only valid for plane waves.
 To use segregation capability of the diffraction grating, it is necessary
 to have a source of plane waves and to measure the light power that go
 to different direction after diffraction from the grating.
 Sources and detector are space localized endpoints.
 But employing lenses, it is possible to convert a space localized mode
 to a angle localized mode., as discussed on the Czerny-Turner configuration
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Czerny-Turner"

\end_inset

.
 This conversion, however, is not perfect.
 In geometrical optics terms, this means that rays that enter parallel in
 a lens (or any other focusin device) does no converge to a single point
 after the lens and with the fase arriving at exaclty the same time(picture?).
 Integrating the lens into the grating, as done in Rowland configuration
 in section

 the potencial to fabricate designs with freedom to choose any geometry

and at an angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{s}$
\end_inset

 can be calculated as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
E_{\text{inc}}=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{n_{\text{eff}}}{\lambda}}\int E_{\text{wg}}\left(y\right)\frac{e^{-jkr_{1}}}{\sqrt{r_{1}}}\left(1-\cos\alpha_{s}\right)dy\]

where 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2\pi n_{\text{eff}}/\lambda$
\end_inset

 is the wavenumber within the slab waveguide, and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\text{wg}}$
\end_inset

 is the electric field profile of the TE-polarized fundamental mode of the
 input waveguide.
 Similarly, the diffracted field 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\text{out}}$
\end_inset

 on the collection wavguides is calculated as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
E_{\text{out}}\left(P''\right)=\eta\sqrt{\frac{n_{\text{eff}}}{\lambda}}\sum_{\text{Grating}}\int_{-D/2}^{+D/2}E_{\text{inc}}\left(y\right)\frac{e^{-jkr_{2}}}{\sqrt{r_{2}}}\frac{\left(\cos\alpha_{i}-\cos\alpha_{d}\right)}{2}dy'\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{d}$
\end_inset

 are the incident and diffracted angles with respect to the normal of each
 grating facet, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is the reflection coefficient of the grating.
 This formula is simplified if we assume that the magnitude of the incident
 field 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|E_{\text{inc}}\right|$
\end_inset

is constant over each facet and the pahse of this field changes linearly
 along the length of the facet
\begin_inset Formula \[
E_{\text{inc}}\left(y'\right)=E_{\text{inc}}\left(y'=0\right)e^{+iky'\sin\alpha_{i}}.\]

This aaproximation is valid if the sie of the facets is small compared with

 This is thye case if the blaze point

The integration of silicon photonics and electronics in a CMOS compatible
 platform enables whole monolithic device such as a wavelength division
 demultiplexer (WDM) integrated with detectors and electronic amplifiers.
 Most silicon-on-insulator (SOI) WDMs with 1 nm channel spacing typically
 cover a spectral range of only 10 nm.
 The small spectral range in typical WDMs is due to the use of arrayed waveguide
 grating (AWG)

 designs where large grating orders are employed to achieve small channel
 spacing which comes with the cost of free spectral range.
 It is possible to increase the spectral range by lowering the grating order
 and adding more waveguides to compensate, but this increases the overall
 chip size.
 Furthermore, due to the high index contrast of the silicon photonics platform,
 the achievable resolution depends on very fine control of the AWG waveguide
 dimensions.
 Here we demonstrate WDM using etched diffraction grating (EDG)

.
 This design is more fabrication tolerant since light is propagating in
 a slab where the only dimension that needs to be controlled is the slab
 thickness.
 It is also more suitable to work at a low grating order because light diffracts
 in a single slab opposed to the two star couplers slabs in the AWG.

Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We designed a WDM that uses a Rowland design with one stigmatic point correction.
 The system was designed so that stigmatic point was located at the central
 waveguide of the 21 output waveguide array.
 The central wavelength was chosen to be 1500 nm and the diffraction order
 was 10.
 The Rowland circle was chosen to be 750 μm.
 The designed grating contains 340 grooves.
 The resulting free spectral range was estimated to be 117 nm, and the groove
 spacing approximately 4 μm.
 The input and output waveguide apertures were 1.4 μm.
 A reference waveguide was placed next to the spectrometer so that the transmiss
ion efficiency could be estimated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Operating wavelength
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the readly avaibility of testing equipment operating at 1460-1610
 nm range we decided to design the system to operate somewhere at this range.
 Germanium detector have a peak detection at 1500 nm so we decided to design
 the spectrometer operating range centered at 1500 nm.

 The system is capable of writing using only beam deflecton on an area (denomina

) of 1x1 mm.
 By moving the sample to be written (process called as 
\emph on
stitching
\emph default
) one is capable of writing a whole 5x5 inches mask.
 Unfortunatelly due to the extreme precision required, it is difficult to
 align the boders of neighboring fields perfectly, with the system working
 its best alignments of 10 nm are possible, though achieving this kind of
 precision is requires a good amount of trials and experience, alignments
 of 50 nm are more routinelly achieved.
 In order to avoid errors in the spectrometer grating during stitching we
 limited the size of the grating in order of it to fit in a single 1x1 mm
 field, which meant placing the grating along the diagonal of the field,
 which, ignoring the grating curvature, gaves us a grating size of 1.4 mm.

The higher the number of grooves the higher resolving power we can get.
 But since we want to limit the grating size, in this particular device
 to 1.4 mm.
 Increasing the number of grooves also means decreaing pitch size and increase
 of diffraction angle, as shown in graph X.

 to align the resonator and spectrometer transmission combs using the thermo-opt
ic effect in silicon.
 The diffraction grating spectrometer contains 25 channels with spacing
 of 1 nm.
 To match the ring resonator FSR to the DG spectrometer channel spacing
 we use an 83.5 m radius ring with waveguide cross-section of 450 x 250 nm.
 The FSR changes with wavelength according to 
\begin_inset Formula $2\lambda/(n_{g}L)$
\end_inset

, but considering a slight positive group velocity dispersion (
\begin_inset Formula $\partial n_{g}/\partial\lambda\approx3.6\times10^{-3}\text{nm}^{-1}$
\end_inset

) this change is extremely small: the total change in FSR across the range
 of operation (25 nm) is approximately 1% for light polarized in the plane
 of the device (TE polarization).

Fabrication

We fabricated the device using CMOS compatible procedures.
 First, we start with an SOI wafer with 250 nm silicon and 3 μm buried oxide.
 An 80 nm layer of SiO2 was deposited using plasma enhanced chemical vapor
 deposition (PECVD) to be used as a hard mask.
 A 200 nm layer of PMMA was spun and then the grating and the waveguides
 were defined using e-beam lithography.
 The pattern was transferred from PMMA the to the oxide layer using CHF3/O2
 reactive ion etch.
 The silicon layer was etched using Cl2 inductively coupled plasmaand then
 2.3 μm of SiO2 was deposited using PECVD to clad the device.
 The wafer was diced and polished for optical testing.

We measured the performance of our WDM and observed -10 dB crosstalk and
 1 nm channel spacing across 21 channels.
 As shown in Fig.
 2, a relatively flat transmission spectrum was obtained.
 This result was measured by inserting light from a tunable laser and measuring
 the power from the output waveguides.
 A fiber polarization controller was used to set the input polarization
 to TE and a polarizer was placed between the chip output and the detector
 to filter out any TM polarized light.
 An insertion loss of -10 dB was estimated by comparing to the transmission
 through the reference waveguide.
 This can be attributed to Fresnel reflection between the Si-SiO2 interfaces
 at the grating groove facet and can be reduced by coating the grating facets
 with a reflective metal.

In conclusion, we demonstrate a one point stigmatic Rowland grating WDM
 with 21 channels, 1 nm channel spacing and better than -10 dB crosstalk.
 Since the free spectral range is greater the 100 nm, by adding additional
 output waveguides it is possible to construct a WDM that covers whole C-band.
