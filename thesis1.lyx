Consider the interferometer shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
 To simplify the analisys, ignore the light polarization and dispersion
 effects.
 A light source emits a radiation whose electric field shine upon a beamspliter
 e described by 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{0}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This light is devided and a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 of its power is directed to mirror 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 with reflectivity 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{s}$
\end_inset

.
 The light is reflected and returns to the beam spliter, where a fraction
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1-D\right)$
\end_inset

 of its power goes to the detector.
 Similarly, in the other interferometer arm, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1-D\right)$
\end_inset

 of the light emited by the light source is redirected to the mirror 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{r}$
\end_inset

, which is reflected and returns to the beamspliter, where a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 of this light is redirected back to the detector.
 The electric field at the detector can be decribed by
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
E_{s}=\sqrt{K_{0}}E_{0}\left(t-\tau_{a}\right)+\sqrt{K_{r}}E_{0}\left(t-\tau_{r}\right),\label{eq:Simplest Field equation}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{i}=R_{i}D\left(1-D\right)$
\end_inset

 is the light power fraction that is shined to the detector and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the time the light takes to go from the beamspliter to the mirror 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and back.

The relationship between the output light intensity 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle I\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and the mean electric field is:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left\langle I\right\rangle =\left\langle \frac{\left|E\left(t\right)\right|^{2}}{2\eta_{0}}\right\rangle ,\label{eq:intensity field relation}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{0}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu_{0}}{\varepsilon_{0}}}$
\end_inset

 is the free space impedance.
 Using 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Simplest Field equation"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:intensity field relation"

\end_inset

, we get the intensity at the detector as been
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left\langle I\right\rangle =\left\langle I_{\text{DC}}\right\rangle +\sqrt{K_{s}K_{r}}\Re\left(\Gamma\left(\tau_{s,a}\right)\right)\label{eq:michelson output intensity equation}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{r,s}=\tau_{s}-\tau_{r}$
\end_inset

.
 We define the autocorrelation function for beam electric field as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Gamma\left(\tau\right)=\frac{E\left(t-\tau\right)E^{*}\left(t\right)}{\eta_{0}}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle I_{\text{DC}}\right\rangle =\sum_{j}K_{j}\left\langle I_{0}\right\rangle ,\]

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle I_{0}\right\rangle =\left\langle \frac{\left|E_{0}\left(t\right)\right|^{2}}{2\eta_{0}}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is the mean light intensity that leaves the source, which in this case
 is constant.
 More specifically, it is of interest that the light source should be stationary
 in the wide sense, which means
\end_layout

Noise due to the quantization of light and electric current.
 The quantity of photons arriving at the detector in a sampling interval

 The distribuition of the number of photons hitting the detector as a poissonian
 lineshape, whose width is equal to the mean number of photons.
 In addition to that, the photoelectron generation ocurs with a probability

 It can be shown, that the photoelectron current has a variance
\begin_inset Formula \[

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Relative intensity noise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Relative intensity noise (RIN) are noise that grows linearly with the mean
 photo-current power.
 A few examples include the optical source power fluctuations.
 The noise spectral density can be model with a white noise over the band
 of interest.
 Therefore, the variance of this noise can be described as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sigma_{RIN}^{2}=e\gamma\left\langle i\right\rangle ^{2}B,\]

\end_inset

 where the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is experimentally measured.
 In practice it is possible to remove this noise using a balanced detection
 system.
 We therefore will not take this noise into consideration in the final calculati

There are two main forms of thermal noise.
 One during detection, when black body radiation and thermal phonons in
 the detector causes the excitation of electrons generating a current with
 mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle i\right\rangle =e\beta k\theta$
\end_inset

 and variance
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sigma_{\theta1}^{2}=e\beta k\theta B,\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

 is a detector geometry and material constant, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$

 is the temperature and

 is the Boltzmann constant.

Also called Johnson-Nyquist noise is the electronic noise generated by the
 thermal agitation of the charge carriers (usually the electrons) inside
 an electrical conductor at equilibrium, which happens regardless of any
 applied voltage.
 It is a zero mean noise with variance equal

Before showing more rigorous derivation of we will show a more intuitive
 picturo on how frequency domain OCT reconstruct it image.
 Let a Michelson interferometer ilustrated on 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:Michelson-interferometer-2"

\end_inset

 and described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Michelson-Interferometer"

\end_inset

.
 It was show in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Michelson-Interferometer"

\end_inset

 that the light intensity in the interferometer output is described by
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle I\right\rangle =\left\langle I_{0}\right\rangle +\frac{\sqrt{K_{r}K_{s}}}{\eta_{0}}\cos\left(2\pi\nu\tau_{r,s}\right).\]

\end_inset

Notice that the equation has a dual behavior relative to optical frequency
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and the time delay 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 Usually, it is easiear to vary the interferometer arm length keeping the
 optical frequency (or wavelength) constant and observe the light intensity
 at the interferometer output.
 We will then see interference fringes as graph on figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:freqGraphSimple"

\end_inset

.
 But if we keep the arms length diference constant and equal 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta l=c\tau/2$
\end_inset

, we can rewrite equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:interference coherent length"

\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle I\right\rangle =\left\langle I_{0}\right\rangle +\frac{\sqrt{K_{r}K_{s}}}{\eta_{0}}\cos\left(2\pi\frac{2\Delta l}{c}\nu\right).\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the oscilation period in inversly proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta l$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, if we know the period of the intensity oscilation in optical
 frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\nu$
\end_inset

, the we can calculate the diference of optical pathlength between the interfero
meter arms, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta l=\frac{c}{2\Delta\nu}$
\end_inset

.

If instead of a mirror we put dielectric sample in place of a sample mirror,
 as show in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:InterferometerBiLayer"

\end_inset

, instead of getting a simple intensity oscilation, we will get a superposition
 of several senoids described by the equation below
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle I\right\rangle =\left\langle I_{0}\right\rangle \left[1+F_{r,1}\cos\left(2\pi\tau_{r,1}\nu\right)+F_{r,2}\cos\left(2\pi\tau_{r,2}\nu\right)+F_{1,2}\cos\left(2\pi\tau_{1,2}\nu\right)\right].\]

\end_inset

The second and the second term in the braces are related to the interference
 between the light from the reference mirror and the interfaces 1 and 2.
 The fourth term is due to the interference of the interfaces 1 and 2 between
 themselves.
 As can be seen by figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:graphics interference bi-layer"

\end_inset

, it is difficult to identify the frequencies of each harmonic associated
 with the interference of light coming from two interfaces.
 However, we can identify the contribution of each harmonic by taking the
 fourier transform of the power spectrum as illustrated in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The presence peak due to the interference between the two interfaces of
 the sample are called 
\emph on

\emph default
, and as can be seen, it creates reconstruction artifacts that obstruct
 the reconstructed image.
 However, note that the distance of the peak is equal to the sample thickness,
 and is independent of the distance between the interfaces and the reference
 distance.
 Therfore, if the distance of the sample surface to the reference is greater
 than the sample thickness, all peaks after the position 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta l_{1,2}$

 are free of the these artifacts.
 In the following section we will show other methods to supress these artifacts.

 Uma fonte de luz de baixa coerência emite uma radi- ação, cujo campo elétrico

 A luz é dividida no acoplador de fibra óptica, onde uma fração D da potência

 A luz então retorna ao acoplador onde (1−D), e vai para o espectrômetro.
 Analogamente, no braço da amostra, (1 − D) da luz emitida pela fonte incidem
 sobre a amostra, onde uma fração Ri que foi retro-refletida ou retro-espalhada
 na camada i retorna à fibra e uma porção D dessa se encaminha para o espectrôme

The principle of FD OCT is based on calculating the auto-correlation function
 of the output light from its power spectrum density.
 Acording to the Wiener-Khinchin theorem the auto-correlation of a function
 and its power spectral density are related by a Fourier Transform.
 Therefore the, power spectral density at the interferometer output is
\begin_inset Formula \[
G\left(\nu\right)=G_{0}\left(\nu\right)\left[\left(K_{r}+\sum_{i}K_{i}\right)+2\sum_{i}K_{r,i}\cos\left(2\pi\nu\Delta\tau_{r,i}\right)+2\sum_{i\ne j}K_{i,j}\cos\left(2\pi\nu\Delta\tau_{i,j}\right)\right],\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the light source PSD.
 We see that the interferometer output PSD is composed of interference fringes
 whose frequencies grows with the delays 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau_{a,b}$
\end_inset

, and is modulated by a envelope equal toe the input light PSD.

Several methods were developed to extract the this term from the auto-correlatio
n function.
 Each method having it own virtues and shortcomings in terms of processing

This method removes the DC peak of the reconstructed image.
 The basic principle relies on filtering out any component that does no

 The phase shift Di in Eq.
 (2) is introduced by the displacement of a mirror in the reference arm

 Movements of the object (during in vivo studies) cause additional (unknown),
 displace- ments dz0i.
 Thus, the total phase shifts D may be ex- pressed as follows:

It must be noted that the polychromatic phase er- ror has been already avoided
 by taking into ac- count the relationship between the phase and optical
 path-length shifts.
 The first approximation of phase shifts Di(m) may be calculated from known
 mirror displace- ment dz (5) with dz0i 1⁄4 0.
 These phases are intro- duced into Eq.
 (2), and ‘‘unwrapped’’ image is reconstructed via Eqs.
 (3) and (4).
 If the object is immobile, the tomogram is free of mirror images but for
 in vivo measurements the ghosts usually appear.
 To remove them completely, the values of dz0i must be taken into account.
 To do so, for every A-scan, the displacements dz0i ; i 1⁄4 1; 2; 3 has
 been adjusted to minimize the function

where Vk is the intensity in kth point of A-scan ob- tained with complex
 method, VK k is the intensity at its mirror image, and the function R represent
s the level of correlation between the A-scan (Vk) and its mirror image
 (VK k).
 The procedure is performed in two steps.
 The first step takes into account possible effect of stea- dy motion of
 the object.
 In this case optical delays for subsequent measurements are still equal
 but their magnitudes differ from that caused solely by the mirror displacement.
 Therefore for every A- scan the new value of ðoz i þ dz0iÞ – including
 both the mirror and object displacements, is estimated in one-dimensional
 Golden Section Search [13] for the minimum of the function R.
 The range where the parameters are sought is 0–kmin/6 to pre- vent the
 situations when the total phase shift D3 reaches 2p or goes beyond that
 limit.
 In the second step dz01 and dz02 are fine adjusted in two-dimen- sional
 conjugate gradient minimalization of func- tion R utilizing the Fletcher–Reeves
 algorithm [14] with dz03 fixed at the value found in the previ- ous stage.
 Due to the symmetry of function R, the re- trieved A-scan may belong to
 either left or right image.
 The choice of initial phases for iteration fa- vours one of them.
 Rare, inverted A-scans are automatically recognized by correlation with
 neighbouring A-scans and reversed.

Applications

\begin_layout Standard
The success of the dental treatment, particularly restoration, depends on
 the integral knowledge of the properties, structure, and function of the
 complex to dentin-pulpar, which consti- tutes the necessary biological
 basis for making clinical deci- sions.
 Despite the differences in structure and composition, pulp and dentin are
 integrally connected in the sense that physiologic and pathologic reactions
 in one of the tissues will also affect the other.
 The two tissues have a common embry- onic origin and also remain in an
 intimate relationship throughout the life of the vital tooth.
 Anything that affects dentin will affect the pulp and vice versa.1 Many
 factors are involved in the pulpal response, such as citotoxicity of the
 dental material, the application method of the restorative material, and
 the presence of bacteria.
 How- ever, it seems that the effects of a restorative preparation, patient
 age, and remaining dentin thickness between cavity floor and pulp tissue
 play an important role in the intensity of pulpal response and stimulation
 of tertiary dentin deposition.2 In addition, during excavation procedures
 and cavity and crown preparation, the pulp may be accidentally exposed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Knowledge of the configuration of the pulpal space and the pulp-dentin complex
 morphology plays an important role to prevent iatrogenic or so-called accidenta
l exposure of the pulp.
 It is often difficult in clinical practice and with conven- tional image
 techniques, such as X-ray, to identify the exact dimensions of the internal
 tooth anatomy.3 To detect the depth of the dental cavity in relation to
 the pulpar chamber, the professionals withhold information col- lected
 through the clinical examination—visual and tactile inspection—and of the
 radiographic examination.
 These methods are subjective, which may lead to the wrong choice for the
 ideal treatment.
 Moreover, the radiographic procedure possesses some limitations for presenting
 overlapping of ana- tomical structures, for being a static method and emitting
 ion- izing radiation.4 The optical coherence tomography OCT consists of
 a new imaging technique for diagnosis that produces bi- or three-dimensional
 pictures, with a few microns of spatial res- olution, and has been widely
 used to study biotissues, as re- viewed in Ref.
 5.
 This technique was initially used in ophthalmology,6 where it is well developed
 and clinically used, but it has been continuously benefiting other areas,
 such as cardiology,7 gastroenterology,8 dermatology,9 and cellular engineering.1

\begin_layout Standard
in 1998,11 having been used for diverse purposes such as char- acterization
 of periodontal structures,12,13 recurrent caries’s detection of and marginal
 adaptation of restorations,14 and precocious detention of oral cancer.15
 More recently, besides evaluation of enamel interface restoration,14 also
 early caries diagnostics16 and the analysis of the performance of the dental
 materials17,18 have been stud- ied and reported by our group.
 In 2006, Kauffman et al.
 per- formed the first OCT image of dental pulps using rat’s teeth.19 The
 key elements of an OCT setup include a broadband light source, whose spectral
 width limits the axial spatial res- olution; an interferometer, which generally
 employs a Mich- elson design containing in one of the arms the sample and
 in the other arm a delay line; and an optical detector, whose signal output
 is electronically treated and fed to a computer for the image generation.
 Two domains can be exploited for implementation of an OCT system: the time
 domain or the spectral domain.
 In the time domain, the optical delay line arm basically consists of either
 a movable arm or a Fourier domain delay line.20 In the spectral domain,
 there are no mov- able parts in the interferometer arms except for lateral
 dis- placement of the beam on the sample, and the recombined beams from
 the interferometer are sent to a spectrometer and are Fourier analyzed.
 It has been shown that spectral domain OCT SD-OCT has several advantages
 over the time domain OCT, including sensitivity21 and fast acquisition
 data, and be- cause the first report on imaging implementation using SD-OCT21
 it has been widespread.
 This work reports the first research comparing images ob- tained by OCT
 of the complex dentin-pulp of in vitro human teeth, using two different
 wavelengths in the near infrared, and also using a conical beam tomography
 as the gold stan- dard.
 The results are compared, and the conclusion that OCT at 1280 nm performs
 better than at 850 nm is obtained, besides corroborating the feasibility
 of OCT for potential clinical use to prevent accidental exposure of the
 pulp and to promote preventive restoration treatment.

Materials and Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experimental study was carried out in accordance with the ethical guidelines
 in research with human participants by Center of Health Sciences, Universidade
 Federal de Pernam- buco, Brazil.
 Higid molar teeth from humans were used in this research.
 The occlusal surfaces of the teeth were prepared with a per- pendicular
 carbide bur along the axis of the teeth producing a plane on that surface,
 which were subsequently polished manually with wet 400, 600-, and 1200-
 water sandpaper sheet with irrigation.
 Wear was performed perpendicular to the long axis of teeth and lasted until
 the occurence of mini- mal cavity pulpal exposure creating a plane on occlusal
 sur- face.
 The wear stopped until the occurrence of minimal cavity pulpal exposure.
 In practice, polishing or surface preparation is not required to obtain
 the images.
 To perform OCT imaging of teeth, we used two home-built OCT systems, whose
 schematic diagrams are shown in Fig.
 1.
 Figure 1a shows the schematic of the SD-OCT system op- erating at the wavelengt
h of 850 nm.
 The broadband source is a superluminescent diode Broadband SLD Lightsource
 S840, SUPERLUM, Moscow, Russia delivering up to 25 mW and with a 49.9-nm
 bandwidth, which gives an axial resolution of 6 m.
 After traveling through the all-fiber beamsplitter, the reflected beams
 from the sample and mirror are recombined and sent through a purpose-designed
 spectrometer consisting of a lens collimator system, 1200-L/mm grating,
 and CCD ATMEL, 2048 pixels, 12 bits, California.
 The maximum in- cident power on the sample was 5 mW.
 The output is sent to a personal computer with a LabView-based imaging
 pro- gram.
 Figure 1b shows the schematic of the time domain OCT system operating at
 the central wavelength of 1280 nm, maxi- mum average power 5 mW, delivered
 by a superluminescent diode model no.
 SLD-571, SUPERLUM, Moscow, Russia, with a 64.6-nm bandwidth, which represents
 an axial reso- lution of 11 m.
 As with the system in Fig.
 1a, an all-fiber beamsplitter is used, but in this case the delay line
 is a Fourier domain delay line20 consisting of a grating and a scanning
 galvo.
 The recombined beams are fed into a photodetector and associated electronics,
 and the output is sent to a personal computer with a LabView-based imaging
 program.
 The images of the remaining dentin thickness and pulp chamber were taken
 by scanning the oclusal surface in a vestibule-lingual direction.
 The laser penetrated into the teeth structure and a tomographic image of
 the frame, parallel to the axis of teeth was obtained.
 After the image construction by OCT 1280 and 850 nm, the teeth were tomographic
ally analyzed using the i-CAT® Cone Beam Volumetric Tomography CBVT imaging
 system Imaging Sciences International, LLC, Pennsylvania, which radiates
 from an X-ray source in a cone shape, encompassing a large volume with
 a single rotation about the sample.
 This tomography system is a new technology used to analyze both double
 jaw anatomies in patients by dentistry when more ac- curacy is required
 on complementary exams.
 The CBVT pro- duces volume imaging in an easier and faster way than con-
 ventional medical computed tomography.22 The scan offers times at 10, 20,
 and 40 s, with standard reconstruction taking 30 s, providing dentists
 with near-instant data for the best possible patient diagnosis, treatment,
 and surgical predictabil- ity.
 The pictures obtained are then reconstructed using algo- rithms to produce
 three-dimensional images at high reso- lution.
 Using the i-CAT software, it was possible to generate sliced 2-D images
 with thickness of 0.12 mm limited by the instrument resolution, eliminating
 the problem of superposi- tion, and these images were then compared to
 the OCT im- ages.

Figure 4 shows an image where the exposition of the pulp cavity is clearly
 seen.
 Figure 4a is the i-CAT CBVT image section, Fig.
 4b the OCT at 1280 nm, and Fig.
 4c the OCT at 850 nm.
 Once again, D and PC are clearly delineated in the OCT image.
 The pulp exposition site PE is seen as a discon- tinuity at the dentin
 surface, which is the homogenous white line of high intensity.
 The OCT images shown allow the direct measurement of the observed region
 depth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to verify the maximum depth that could be achieved for each OCT
 system, we carried out a series of measurements whereby the studied dentin
 region was being reduced by polishing until the pulp could be identified.
 The scale shown in Figs.
 5a and 5b clearly demonstrate the capacity of quantitative assessment of
 the OCT, as well as the maximum penetration depth of the radiation inside
 of the den- tin region.
 Comparing the measurements of the deeper ceiling of the pulp chamber visualized
 at the two different wave- lengths 1280 and 850 nm, respectively, the remaining
 mea- sured dentin thickness was 1000m at 1280 nm and 600 m at 850 nm system.
 These values had already been corrected for the dentin refractive index
 1.5.11 The deeper penetration depth of the light at 1280 nm com- pared to
 850 nm is due to a remarkable reduction of absorp- tion and scattering
 coefficients of the dentin at 1280 nm.23 As a final example, Fig.
 6 shows a superposition of three different images from OCT at 1280 nm,
 taken at the same sample, showing the view of the longitudinal slice detecting
 cusps C, D, and the vestibular and palatine pulp horn, where it is possible
 to identify a remaining thin layer of dentin of roughly 260 and 600 m PC1
 and PC2 between the cavity floor and pulp chamber.
 This is another clear demonstration of the potential of OCT for pulp chamber
 assessment.

\begin_layout Section
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Citotoxicity of the dental material, deep cavity preparation, and accidental
 exposition of pulp tissue are factors that can be involved with the pulp
 irritation.
 The OCT is a new modality of image capable to diagnose the complex dentin
 pulp and to produce images through the dentin substratum, being able to
 measure with precision the distance between the endings of the cavity to
 pulp chamber.
 OCT provided images into remi- niscent dentinal to pulp cavity of about
 1000 m 1280 nm and 600 m 850 nm in depth.
 Before any restoring procedure, care must be taken to properly evaluate
 and protect the dentine and the pulp against physical, chemical, and bacterial
 aggressions.
 The protection strategies depend basically on the depth of the cavity,
 the age of the patient, the remaining dentine thickness, and the indi-
 cated restoring material.
 The depth is determined by the re- maining dentine thickness between cavity
 floor and the pulp chamber’s ceiling.24 The remaining dentin thickness of
 500 m should be enough to protect the pulp tissue against the cytotoxic
 effects of dental materials,25 and the remaining dentin thickness of 300
 m may provoke a persistent inflammatory pulpal response.
 As expected, these results show that the greater the dentin thickness is,
 the more minor the injuries suffered for the pulp are.26 The OCT is a potential
 image technique that may contrib- ute to prevent accidental pulp exposures
 in clinical practice and help pulp protection, by quantitatively determining
 the remaining dentin, thus helping to make the excavation proce- dures
 more predictable and safe.

 The square region marked is the zoom region shown in Fig.

 The dimen- sions in Figs.

 Figure 2 shows a remaining dentin thickness of 120 m, which was thick enough

The OCT images at the wavelengths of 1280 and 850 nm for the zoomed-in region
 shown in the i-CAT CBVT image of Fig.
 2b are seen in Figs.
 3a and 3b, respectively, which also show the structural components of the
 pulp-dentin com- plex.
 The structures in the OCT images are distinguished due to the different
 gray levels or blue levels, in the case of the 850 nm system, where the
 contour of the chamber to pulp appears whiter highest scattered intensities
 and the dentin with the darker level lowest scattered intensity.
 Those struc- tures are clearly delineated due to influence of the structure
 of the biological components with distinct refractive indices, which backscatte
rs light in very different ways.
 No pulp ex- position is observed, as confirmed by the i-CAT CBVT, and comparing
 Figs.
 2b, 3a, and 3b, it clearly demonstrates the capacity of quantitative measuremen
t by the OCT with remaining dentin thickness measured as 120 m.
 Note that the measurements in the OCT value showed on the scale must be
 divided by the refraction index of dentine 1.5.11 The black transversal region,

An optical coherence tomography (OCT) system with 6 lm spatial resolution
 was employed to image the sites of fracture initiation and slow crack propagati
on in a fiber reinforced composite.
 Bar specimens (2 mm · 3 mm · 25 mm) of fiber reinforced composite were
 mechanically and thermally cycled to emulate oral conditions.
 The interior of the samples were analyzed prior and after the emulations.
 We analyzed the specimens that were intact after the loading cycling.
 The results demonstrated the capacity of the OCT technique to generate
 images of the sites fracture initiation, crack propagation, and regions
 surrounding the fracture, and it can be used in the future for quantitative
 analysis thus complementing other existing methods, with the main advantage
 of being non-destructive and non- invasive.

Intro
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is now a well established non-invasive
 imaging technique with real-time capability, as reviewed in [1–3].
 It has been applied to a variety of studies and clinical trials in different
 health related areas, including dermatology [3], dentistry [4] and ophthalmolog
y [5], among others [3].
 The key elements of an OCT setup include a broadband source, whose spectral
 width limits the axial spatial resolu- tion; an interferometer, which generally
 employs a Michel- son design containing in of the arms the sample and in
 the other arm a delay line and an optical detector, whose signal output
 is electronically treated and fed to a computer for the image generation.
 Two domains can be exploited for implementation of an OCT system: the time
 domain or the spectral domain.
 In the time domain, the optical delay line arm basically consists of either
 a movable arm or a Fourier domain delay line [3].
 It has been shown more recently that spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) has several
 advantages over the time domain OCT, including sensitiv- ity [6] and fast
 acquisition data, and since the first report on imaging implementation
 [7] its use has been widespread [3,6,8].
 The SD-OCT can be implemented in two ways: either spectrally resolving
 the signal, as described in Ref.
 [7], or spectrally scanning the optical source, as demon- strated later
 [3].
 The purpose of this in vitro study was to analyze the fracture propagation
 on fiber reinforced composites by SD-OCT.
 Fiber reinforced composites (FRC) have been used for a variety of dental
 applications, including tooth splinting, replacement of missing teeth,
 treatment of dental emergencies, and reinforcement of resin provisional
 fixed prosthodontic restorations, orthodontic retention, and other clinical
 applications.
 Different fiber types are avail- able, but little clinical information
 has been disseminated.
 The traditional microscopy investigation, most commonly used to study this
 material, is a destructive technique, which requires specimen sectioning
 and are essentially sur- face measurements.
 On the basis of these considerations, we employed SD-OCT to analyze non-destruc
tively and non-invasively the interior of a dental sample reinforced with
 fiber, after it has undergone a mechanical and thermal cycling to emulate
 oral conditions.
 In the long-term, frac- tures allow bacterial invasion provoking plaque
 and calcu- lus formation that can cause caries and periodontal disease.
 Therefore, non-invasive imaging of the bridge fiber enables the possibility
 of periodic clinical evaluation to ensure the patient health.
 Furthermore, OCT images can provide a powerful method for quantitative
 analysis of fracture initi- ation and crack propagation, and can potentially
 be used for in vivo assessment.

\begin_layout Section
Experimental details
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fig.
 1 shows the SD-OCT experimental set up.
 A tita- nium:sapphire mode-locked optical oscillator, operating at 800
 nm with a spectral width of 10 nm and emitting pulses of 150 fs, was used
 as the initial system light source.
 The laser beam was coupled into 2.2 m of a monomode fiber (FS-SN-4224, Thorlabs)
, leading to a spectral broad- ening, due to dispersive self-phase modulation
 [9–11].
 The initial 10 nm spectral width and 500 mW of power was broadened to 50
 nm as shown in Fig.
 2, which could lead to a higher longitudinal spatial resolution (DZ).
 In the Z direction, resolution can be calculated from the expression DZ
 = 0.44k2/Dk [3], which gives a value of 5.6 lm in air.
 The light was shone in a free space Michelson interferom- eter.
 In one arm (reference arm) the light was reflected back to the interferometer
 by a mirror fixed to a piezoelectric translator controlled by PC via parallel
 port.
 The longitu- dinal displacement of the piezoelectric was regulated using
 a simple voltage divider circuit.
 A variable attenuator was used to control the amount of light returning
 to the beam splitter.
 In the other arm (objective arm) an achromatic lens with focal length of
 50 mm was used to focus the light on the sample, providing a lateral resolution
 of 30 lm.
 The dispersion caused by the focusing lens was matched in the reference
 arm using a piece of glass.
 We used a computer controlled three dimensional step motor translator (Z625B,
 Thorlabs) to scan the sample transversally while making the acquisition.
 The output light was then coupled into handheld spectrometer (USB2000,
 Ocean Optics).
 The basic principle behind the spectral domain OCT is the clever use of
 the Wiener–Khinchin theorem, that relates the light spectrum with its autocorre
lation function.
 Although the basic theory of SD-OCT has been described before [7], we describe
 here some important equations for the sake of clarity and completeness.
 Considering E(t) as being the input light’s electric field, the electric
 field in the output put of the interferometer can be modeled as being:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Graphics
	filename /Users/bernardo/Dropbox/thesis/pasted9.pdf

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Eq.
 (1) Kr, (Ki) is the fraction of input light power that was reflected in
 a point r, (i) back to the interferome- ter, sr, (si) is the time of flight
 the light takes to go from an input point to the point r, (i) and then
 to the output.
 The subscript r refers to the reference arm and i refers to a point in
 the sample.
 The autocorrelation of the output electric field function is then:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename /Users/bernardo/Dropbox/thesis/pasted10.pdf

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Eq.
 (2), C(t) represents the autocorrelation of the input light and Dsn,m =
 sm sn.
 Since the input light has a large bandwidth then, due to the uncertainty
 principle which leads to the time-bandwidth product being a con- stant,
 C(t) is a highly sharp function at it’s origin.
 The first two terms in Eq.
 (2) are parasitic terms that will be removed later, whilst the last terms
 are symmetric functions that con- tain the information about the sample.
 Since sr is constant, it can be seen that in each of the two last terms
 there is going to be a peak centralized at Dsr,i, with amplitude propor-
 tional to the squared root of the fraction of light power that returned
 from the sample from point i.
 The idea is that the autocorrelation function can be computed through the
 Wie- ner–Khinchin theorem by taking the Fourier transform of the power
 spectrum density Gout(m) of the light coming out of the interferometer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fig.
 3a shows the experimentally obtained autocorrela- tion of the output light
 of our SD-OCT system with a mir- ror as a sample.
 The central peak in the graph corresponds to the first parasitic term of
 Cout(t), and the other two sym- metric peak correspond to the last two
 terms, where Dl is the difference of distance the light traveled to go
 to the ref- erence and sample mirror.
 To eliminate the parasitic and one of the symmetric terms a second spectrum
 Gp=2 of the out output light is taken, this time with the reference mirror
 displaced by a distance of d = k/8.
 This will cause a phase shift of p/2 on the spectrum fringes.
 It can be shown that using the relation:

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a free of parasitic and symmetric signal can be obtained.
 Where the Fourier Transform was denoted as FT and the complex number norm
 was represented by jj jj.
 A result of this algorithm can be seen in (b), which shows the exper- imental
 result obtained with the displacement of d = k/8 introduced by the piezoelectri
c, where the central parasitic and one of the symmetric peaks has suppressed
 with an effi- ciency of at least 32 dB.
 A closer look at the peak, Fig.
 3c shows the system experimental resolution of 6 ± 0.5 lm, quite close to
 the theoretically calculated value of 5.6 lm.
 With 2 mW of optical power incident on the sample, a sys- tem sensibility
 of 98 ± 5 dB was measured independently, following the procedure of Ref.
 [6].
 The figure is within the estimated value of 95 dB.
 The high sensibility error is attributed manly due to the light source
 instability.
 The data acquisition and image generation were con- trolled by a Labview
 supported software.
 The software acquired two sets of spectra, each with a different displace-
 ment in the reference arm.
 The acquisition was done while the sample was transversally moved after
 a couple of spec- tra were measured.
 Using spline interpolation, a spectra with points evenly distributed in
 frequency was obtained from a spectra that was evenly distributed in wavelength.
 Then, from each couple of spectra a tomogram was calcu- lated using Eq.
 (3).
 During the scan all tomograms are lat- erally stacked forming a 2D matrix.
 By mapping a color (or gray intensity) to each value of the 2D matrix an
 image of the scanned sample is reconstructed.

Fiber reinforced composite studies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the oral cavity, prosthetic reconstructions are usually under conditions
 of thermal variation and loading condi- tions.
 Such thermal cycling and cycling loading may cause fractures during long-term
 clinical use [12,13].
 Fatigue frac- ture after years in clinical use was found to be a common
 failure reason.
 The longevity of restorations is dependent upon many factors, including
 operator skill, the materials and techniques used, the criteria for replacement
, patient compliance with oral hygiene advice, the oral environment and
 its contribution to the patient’s susceptibility to caries and possibly,
 the means by which the treatment is funded.
 Relatively few studies have investigated these factors [14].
 Fatigue in dental restoratives is also influenced by corrosive water attack
 at a certain temperature (37°) and by cycling masticatory forces.
 The naturally occurring loading of a filling was estimated [15] at between
 5 and 20 MPa.
 Con- temporary approaches to fatigue principles consider a frac- ture process
 in three phases: crack initiation, slow crack growth, and fast fracture.
 The latter phase is very short in duration and thus the time of crack initiatio
n and of slow crack growth account for the useful fatigue resistance of
 a material.
 Crack initiation nucleates at heterogeneities like surface and subsurface
 microcracks, porosities, filler particles, crazes, etc.
 within the materials.
 Cycling loading is able to drive a crack, called slow crack growth.
 Additional water exposure causes a variety of weakening effects on resin
 composites: degradation of the filler-matrix interface, elation, and swelling
 or a visco- elastic effect on the matrix which all accelerate slow crack
 growth [16].
 To assess the possibility of fracture initiation and crack evolution analysis,
 sample bars of dimensions 2 mm · 3 mm · 25 mm were prepared.
 Using a split mold, 1 mm- layer of particulate filler CR (Suprafill 3M/ESPE)
 was placed into the split mold, then a dental fiber DF (Interlig, Angelus)
 was placed.
 Another layer of CR was applied immediately after polymerization of DF
 on the top of the fiber reinforced composite (FRC) substructure, leaving
 the thickness of the specimen at 2.00 mm.
 The light poly- merization was performed with a halogen light.
 Fig.
 4a shows a photograph of a section of the FRC where we can see the fiber.
 The OCT image, Fig.
 4b, confirms the ability to see the substructure of the composite.
 Because of the refractive index of the resin the vertical dimensions inside
 sample needs to be corrected by a factor of 1.5.
 Before the load test, all the specimens were thermally cycled in 1000 cycles
 between 5 and 55 °C.
 The thermal cycling consisted of a 5 s transfer between temperature baths.
 From the OCT images, no difference in the samples were detected by analyzing
 the images before and after the thermal cycles [17].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the mechanical cycling, the specimens were tested in three points loading,
 depicted in Fig.
 5, in a universal test- ing machine (Kratos Equipamentos Industriais LTDA,
 SP, Brazil).
 The load was applied to standard bar specimens with a loading angle of
 90°, a crosshead speed of 3.0 mm/min and the distance between the two supports
 was 8 mm.
 Cyclic loading was carried out to 100 cycles or until the specimens failed.
 Fig.
 6a and b show the OCT images of the sample, for a particular cycling load
 of 60 N.
 The images were taken as schematized in Fig.
 5.
 Scanning was not straightforward because the cycling cracked the resin
 surface leaving particles that scattered the light obfuscating the region
 below the point of contact and often saturating the detector.
 There are three characteristics regions surrounding the fracture origin
 on the fracture surface of brittle material.
 The first region is generally a relatively smooth (mirror) region, the
 second is a slightly stippled (mist) region and the third is a very coarse
 (hackle) region.
 This last region leads to macroscopic crack branching that is, the bifurca-
 tion of the main crack.
 The formation of these three regions occurs at a constant characteristic
 stress intensity factor [18].
 In Fig.
 6a, left hand side, it is shown the OCT image prior the cycling.
 Capital A indicates the image of dental fiber and capital B shows the distance
 from the surface of beam to the top of dental fiber (about 400 lm).
 On the right hand side, Figure (b), shows the results after cycling where
 the capital letters indicates: C-Flaw initiation site, D-Splinter region,
 E-Hackle region.
 We can note the exten- sion of propagation about 900 lm from the flow initiatio
n site to the end of hackle region.
 This result demonstrates the possibility to study how crack initiates and
 propagates inside the dental material.
 It should be pointed out that, at 40 N load (not shown) the crack starts
 to form, but the resin is still intact.
 At 80 N load, the sample was fractured.

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, we have used the SD-OCT technique to generate images of a
 FRC embedded in a composite resin.
 The Ti-sapphire-optical fiber combination used as an opti- cal source of
 broadband emission, giving a practical axial resolution of 6 lm could be
 substituted by a simpler source, such as a super luminescent LED, provided
 it delivered an axial resolution of the order of 10–15 lm.
 The results dem- onstrated the capacity of the OCT technique to generate
 images of the sites fracture initiation, crack propagation, and, regions
 surrounding the fracture.
 Similar images could be obtained with time domain OCT, but SD-OCT is more
 practical due to its improved sensitivity and fast acquisition data, besides
 higher stability as there is no movable part.
 The measurements were performed in phantoms, but it is known that the penetrati
on depth in real tooth can cover the whole enamel extension [19] and therefore
 imaging fiber to a 2 mm depth is feasible in real life.
 The use of 1300 nm wavelength, which has a higher penetration depth in
 enamel, will provide penetration depth up to 5–6 mm [20].

Since fracture is a major reason for clinical failure of dental restoration,
 and is generally preceded by slow crack propagation, the method shown here
 can be used for anal- ysis of in-service failure of dental materials and,
 although it was only qualitatively analyzed here, it can be used in the
 future for quantitative analysis thus complementing other methods [21].

We have applied Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) clinically to assess
 dental restorations in humans.
 Twenty patients with resin composite restorations in anterior teeth were
 selected and evaluated using a conventional radiographic examination, visual
 inspection and OCT.
 Images were obtained using a home built OCT system operating in the spectral
 domain, with an 850 nm superluminescent diode light source.
 The results were analyzed with respect to the integrity and marginal adaptation
 of the restoration.
 Using appropriate software failed and failing restorations, including those
 with lesioned regions, could be located prior to the placement of a new
 restoration.
 Lesions and failed restorations were identified with the OCT system that
 could not be seen by conventional visual and X-ray examinations and these
 were found to be present on surgical intervention.
 This in vivo study demonstrates that the OCT technique has a great potential
 to be used in clinical practice to assess dental restorations and prevent
 recurrent caries.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In recent years, several methods using light have been proposed to address
 the need for better detection and diagnostic tools in dentistry.
 Digital imaging fibre-optic transillumination (DIFOTI), multi-photon imaging,
 quantitative light fluorescence (QLF), infrared fluorescence (DIAGNOdent),
 infrared thermography, Raman spectroscopy, optical coherence tomography
 (OCT) and terahertz imaging are a few techniques that are currently under
 evaluation for improved diagnosis [1-4].
 2 3 Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a recent, but well established
 low- coherence interferometric technique that allows the acquisition of
 high-resolution, non- invasive, cross-sectional images of biological tissue
 based on the detection of backscattered light [5,6].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OCT has already been applied in vitro and in vivo to a variety of medical
 specialties, including Ophthalmology [5], Dermatology [7], Gastroenterology
 [8], Cardiology [9] and Cellular Engineering [10].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first study applying OCT to be carried out in Dentistry, both in vitro
 and in vivo, was in 1998, using a prototype handpiece for the characterization
 of both hard and soft dental tissues [11, 12].
 In 2003, a commercial prototype OCT system was adapted to a commercial
 surgical microscope to perform in vitro and in vivo images of carious lesions
 and restorations [13].
 OCT has also been employed for the early detection of oral cancer [14].
 In vitro studies evaluating enamel interface restoration [15], early caries
 diagnostics [16], and analysis of the performance of dental materials [17]
 have also been reported.
 In 2006, the first OCT image of dental pulp was performed using rat’s teeth
 [18].
 Recently, remaining dentin and the pulp chamber from human teeth were also
 imaged by OCT in vitro as reported in [19].
 Endodontic applications of OCT have been explored in order to evaluate
 root canals [20] and Sinescu and co-workers used OCT to investigate the
 marginal adaptation of fixed dental prosthesis before installing them in
 patients [21].
 However, little work has been reported on OCT being used in a clinical
 setting as part of a clinical evaluation, specifically looking at restoration
 integrity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dental restorations provide a barrier restricting oral fluids and bacteria
 from entering the tooth after the removal of any damaged or missing tissue.
 An inadequate marginal seal can result in gap formation that leads to microleak

 responsible for marginal breakdown, recurrent caries, increased post-operative
 sensitivity, pulpal inflammation, and staining [22].
 Microleakage, either from small or microscopic openings between the margins
 of the composite restoration and tooth is considered to be a major cause
 of restoration failure [23].
 Microleakage can also result in bacteria penetrating the tooth-restoration
 space and into dentinal tubules, where secondary decay may occur and bacterial
 toxins will irritate the pulp.
 The oral environment, including occlusal forces and temperature variation,
 as well as the differences between the physical properties of teeth and
 restorative materials, polymerization shrinkage, the coefficient of thermal
 expansion, and modulus of elasticity can all contribute to microleakage.
 According to previous literature, if poor bond strength exists between
 the tooth and restorative material, a failure of adhesion may be caused
 by polymerization shrinkage, and microscopic gaps at the tooth-restoration
 interface can subsequently form [15, 22, 23].
 The success of the restorative treatment depends on the integrity of the
 tooth- restoration interface and this particular region is the subject
 of much research and discussion in the Dental community.
 Clinically, the most common tools for detection of restorative failures
 are by tactile and/or visual inspection or by radiographic examination.
 However, since initial microleakages can be clinically and radiographically
 imperceptible, secondary caries may currently progress before the problem
 can be detected by the dental practitioner.
 A recent study evaluating the enamel-restoration interface using OCT, in
 which just one patient was reported, has been published [24] and Negritu
 et al.
 [25] used OCT and confocal microscopy to investigate dental structures
 and restoration materials using extracted teeth.
 4 Here we present an in vivo study employing a home built OCT system, operating
 in the spectral domain using a superluminescent diode at 850 nm, to detect
 failures at the enamel-dental restoration interface, and the integrity
 of superficial and internal structures of restorations in a clinical setting.
 This study was undertaken with 20 patients attending the Dentistry College
 of the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco.
 The relatively large number of attending patients allowed us to obtain
 and analyze the results in a very consistent manner.
 Results were compared to conventional radiographs and clinical examination,
 represented here by photographs.

\begin_layout Standard
This study was developed according to the guidelines given by Ethical Committee
 in Human Research of the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Brazil.
 Twenty patients with resin composite restorations in upper anterior teeth
 were selected.
 These patients were between 18 and 45 years old, both male and female,
 and had their restorations performed between 1999 and 2009.
 All the restorations had a superficial satisfactory clinical aspect with
 no obvious aesthetic failures such as staining, undesirable shape or obvious
 missing material.

st{OCT performs high-resolution, cross-sectional tomographic imaging of
 the internal microstructure in materials and biological systems by measuring
 backscattered or backreflected light.
 The intensity of the signal is a function of the scattering caused by the
 local changes in tissue structure of the tooth.
 Variations in scattering measured in relation to depth from a single point
 on the tooth surface are called an "A-scan".
 Taking several A-scans along a line produces information from a 'slice'
 of tooth tissue, which is the tomogram.
 The movement along the line of A-scans is known as the "B-scan" [1].

\begin_layout Plain Layout

The key elements of an OCT system include a broadband light source, whose
 spectral width largely sets the axial spatial resolution; an interferometer,
 which generally employs a Michelson design, with one of the arms containing
 the sample and in the other arm, a delay line; and an optical detector,
 whose signal output is electronically treated and fed to a computer for
 the image generation.
 In the spectral domain (SD-OCT), there are no movable parts in the interferomet
er arms (except for lateral displacement of the beam on the sample), and
 the recombined beams from the interferometer are sent to a spectrometer
 and are Fourier analyzed [26].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

The schematic diagram of the home-built OCT operating in the spectral domain,
 which was used in this study is shown in figure 1(a), and is the same as
 reported previously [19] where the full experimental details are described.
 The centre wavelength of the system was selected to be around 850 nm.
 Although longer wavelengths penetrate more deeply into the sample due to
 a lower scattering coefficient, this lower scattering coefficient also
 means a loss of sensitivity to slight changes in refractive indices.
 In order to maximize the sensitivity to changes we therefore opted for
 a shorter wavelength compared to the 1300 nm that reported previously [24,
 25].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

In summary, the output emission from a superluminescent diode (Broadband
 SLD Lightsource S840, SUPERLUM, Moscow, Russia) operating at 850 nm, with
 a spectral width of 49.9 nm and a fiber output power 25 mW was sent to a
 Michelson interferometer setup providing an axial resolution of 6 μm.
 In the reference arm a mirror was mounted on a piezoelectric base, whilst
 in the sample arm, a mirror controlled by a Galvanometer motor was used
 to scan the light on the sample.
 The reflected and back- scattered light coming from both arms was then
 recombined at the beam splitter and collected by a spectrometer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

The maximum incident power on the sample was approximately 5 mW.
 The beam incident on the sample was focused using an achromatic 50 mm focal
 length (numerical aperture = 0.25) lens.
 For a typical beam diameter of 1 mm before the focusing lens, the lateral
 resolution was 54m.
 The axial resolution is set, predominantly, by the bandwidth of the source,
 whereas the lateral resolution is determined by the numerical aperture
 of the final lens system.
 The lateral resolution is thus a compromise between the working distance
 and size of the final lens.
 To increase the lateral resolution one would shorten the working distance
 of the system, making it less useful for clinical applications, thus we
 opted for a lateral resolution of 54 microns and an acceptable working
 distance of around 50mm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

This optical delivery system was mounted on a 2D translation stage, though
 as the beam passes off a scanning galvo, this is used to scan either in
 the X or Y direction for data acquisition and only one axis of the translation
 stage was used for lateral movement of the imaging system.
 The control of the scanning systems was undertaken by a personal computer
 with a LabView based imaging program.
 A photograph of the entire system is shown in figure 1(b).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

The signal produced by the spectrometer was also sent to the same computer
 which thus both controlled the scanning and data processing.
 The software generated an image into a fixed size screen (stored as a .png
 file) and a numeric array matrix (stored as a .dat file) containing the
 information about the A-scans and B-scan of each image, composed by 512
 lines and 512 columns.
 As the LabView screen had a fixed size, the image file presented distortions
 along its longitudinal axis but provided the clinician with a real time
 image of the area under examination.
 The correctly sized image was obtained through subsequent manipulation
 of the .dat using the Image J software (NIH, USA).
 These processed images enabled the exact position of any restoration failure
 to 7 be seen clearly through the use of an appropriate colored look-up
 table and subsequently located and precisely measured.}

\begin_layout Standard
To perform the OCT examination, a lip retractor was used on the patients,
 and their heads were positioned in an appropriate support, in front of
 the sample arm, seen in figures 1(b) and 1(c).
 The image acquisition time is less than one second (for each image, there
 was 0.1 second of pre-scan settling time and 80 μs of integration time)
 though the support was used to minimize movement which would otherwise
 blur the high optical resolution images.
 The authors analyzed the results with respect to the integrity and marginal
 adaptation of the restoration by visual inspection of the images in real
 time as well as on the images produced from the subsequent image processing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As comparison criteria to OCT, we employed the diagnostic methods most widely
 used in dentistry: a clinical examination composed of visual and/or tactile
 inspection (shown in this paper by photographs) and a conventional X-ray.
 The dental X-Ray equipment used was the Spectro 70X (Dabi Atlante, Ribeirão
 Preto, São Paulo, Brazil), operating at 70 kVp head power and a head current
 of 8 mA.
 The radiographic film used was Kodak Dental Intraoral E-Speed Film (Carestream
 Health Inc., Rochester, New York, United States), and the dental developer
 and fixer, was from the same manufacturer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During a clinical examination, it is possible to detect changes in resin
 composite color, polishing failures, contact point problems and major gaps
 and fissures; radiographic images can show excess or lack of restorative
 material, large areas of demineralization (typically greater than 30% of
 mineral loss), and gaps or fractures points larger than the minimum detection
 size observed by OCT.
 A well designed OCT system, on the other hand, is able to indicate micrometer
 sized external problems such as superficial cracks, and internal defects
 (air bubbles, cracks and their respective 8 growth, voids, gaps and fissures)
 as well as the characteristics of a specific composite material.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To evaluate the presence, or otherwise, of failures in the restorations,
 three experienced professionals, all of them Restorative Dentistry professors,
 were trained to interpret OCT images.
 Each professor was then individually shown the clinical photograph of each
 restoration in question, and requested to complete a form describing what
 they could see in that patient’s image in terms of the restoration extension,
 and if there was any form of failure.
 In case of detected failure they were then asked to classify the failure.
 Then, the radiographic images were shown, in the same way and, last, the
 OCT images.
 To analyze the data a Kappa coefficient test was applied.
 Kappa coefficient is a statistical measure of the agreement for qualitative/cat
egorical items; its aim is not to compare the diagnostic potential between
 the three techniques employed, but to compare how the evaluators agree
 among themselves in each form of diagnostic technique separately.
 After the analysis all of the patients that presented failures in their
 restorations were recalled to the clinic and had new procedures performed
 after a discussion with the patient following the approved clinical procedure.

OCT images were obtained from vertical slices of the tooth, as indicated
 in figure 2.
 The scan was always mapped from left to right.
 The lateral distance between each image was 0.2 mm.
 For didactic reasons, we have only shown some tomograms of each tooth.
 The upper part of image corresponds to the cervical region and the lower
 part, the incisal region.

Features seen in the OCT images were interpreted by reference to the literature
 and also to previous ex vivo studies by the authors, where the teeth were
 imaged via OCT and subsequently sectioned and histologically studied by
 light microscopy.
 It can be shown in figure 3, in which 3(a), 3(c), 3(e) and 3(g) represent
 OCT images of different samples restored in composite resin, and 3(b),
 3(d), 3(f) and 3(h), their respective optical microscopy images.
 In figures 3(a) and 3(b) we can see an example of a well placed and sound
 restoration, whilst 3(c)/3(d) and 3(e)/3(f) show the air bubble presence
 (within the circle) close to the tooth restoration interface, as well as
 the dentin- enamel junction.
 The white appearance of the air bubbles in the optical microscopy images
 is due to the smear layer impregnation during the teeth sectioning with
 diamond wheel.
 Figures 3(g) and 3(h) show an aesthetic facet, in which is possible to
 observe the tooth-restoration limits (arrows), the dentin-enamel junction
 and, specially, the use of different shades of composite resin (large rectangle
s).

Restorations involving medium and incisal regions of a central incisor,
 performed in 2001 in another patient are shown in figure 6, where Fig.
 6(a) shows the clinical photograph with no sign of failure, and different
 colors between the resin composite and the dental enamel.
 In Fig.
 6(b), the conventional radiograph, it is possible to observe excess restorative
 material at proximal surfaces; and Fig.
 6(c) shows the OCT image sequence.
 The arrow here indicates the well placed enamel-restoration interface.
 However, several undesirable features can be identified: air bubble (within
 the circle); evidence of a gap between the enamel and the restorative material
 (identified by the dots); superficial defects and internal fractures in
 the resin composite (identified by the triangles).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some cases, a restoration does not necessarily need to present failures
 throughout its entire structure to be considered for replacement and they
 may well show one part which is well placed and intact whilst another area
 has problems.
 This can also be seen in figures 6(c) and 7.
 In the first slice of Fig.
 6(c), we can see an arrow that indicates the well placed enamel-restoration
 interface, but in subsequent slices, we can see some failures, described
 previously.
 The same situation can be seen in figure 7, with a restoration involving
 medium and incisal regions.
 Arrows indicate the well placed 12 enamel-restoration interface; dots indicate
 enamel-restoration microleakages; triangles indicate evidence of superficial
 fissures at the resin composite; another feature is the different pseudo
 color of the resin composite at the incisal region when compared to medium
 region, marked with the large rectangles.
 This can be seen by OCT because lighter colors of resin have lower refractive
 indices, and thus this modifies the scattering in this region.

In figure 8, we can see a sequence of failures over the entire structure
 of an incisal restoration (dots), beside the dentin-enamel junction.

Finally, in figure 9, we can observe three different aesthetic facets.
 In the region indicated by the diamonds, problems with the cervical adaptation
 of the restorations are identified in Figs.
 9(a) and 9(b), whereas a well suited adaptation is seen in Fig.
 9 (c).
 None of these clinically important defects, seen by OCT, could be observed
 in the clinical images and X-rays, even when they were subsequently examined
 after the detecting a problem in the OCT data sets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 2 shows the Kappa coefficient results for each form of diagnostic
 examination.
 It can be seen that for clinical and radiographic examinations there was
 a substantial agreement between the evaluators, whilst for the OCT examinations
 the Kappa index obtained demonstrates perfect agreement: it means that
 the OCT images provide more accurate information to diagnostic than the
 clinical photographs and the X-ray exam.
 It was not possible to compare the kinds of failures seen in each type
 of examination, as the OCT is able to visualize internal structures that
 are impossible to be seen in the clinical inspection or radiographic examinatio
n.

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The improvements in the esthetic and physical properties of composite resins
 over the past ten years have established them as the material of choice
 for restorations of anterior teeth when used in conjunction with the acid-etch
 technique and dental bonding systems [27].
 However, their high aesthetic quality frequently makes it harder to see
 early signs of failure and due to the way that these materials behave,
 compared to traditional amalgam and gold restorations, early failure is
 more likely.
 Failures at the tooth-restoration interface can be associated with several
 factors including incorrect restorative technique, the physical properties
 of the materials used and, especially, the contraction of the material
 generated during the polymerization of the restorative material.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An adequate marginal adaptation and the integrity of the restoration are
 fundamental to the success of the dental treatment: failures in the marginal
 surface cause microleakage and bacteria infiltration; loss of integrity
 can be present in the internal or superficial structure of the restoration,
 and reduces the quality of the restoration, leading to early fracture of
 the restorative treatment.
 Some defects seen in this study are known to cause a loss of integrity
 in resin based composite restorations including air bubbles in the restoration,
 regions without material under the restoration (voids), cracks and fissures
 at the resin composite and gaps.
 When these kinds of failures are present and the restorative procedure
 is not adequate, a new treatment should be discussed with the patient.

 the dentin enamel junction was evidenced by several authors [11, 12, 13];
 Melo et al (2005) [15] presented induced marginal microleakage; Sadr et
 al (2009) [24] had shown the evolution of a marginal microleakage to a
 secondary caries with absence of restorative material under the restoration;
 the absence of restorative material in the interface between the restoration
 and the dental tissue (similar to that we have shown in figure 5), presence
 of gaps, as well as crack points of the restorative material were presented
 by Negritu et al (2009) [25]; air bubble and gaps were also presented in
 the study performed by Feldchtein et al (1998) [12] and, finally, crack
 propagation into the resin composite was described by Braz et al (2009)
 [17].

The current methods clinically used to diagnosis are not able to visualize
 micrometric structures.
 In the radiographic examination, for example, an early enamel caries lesion
 is visible only after approximately 30%–40% mineral loss [28].
 This deficiency makes it difficult to diagnose early recurrent caries,
 when an earlier diagnosis means an easier and less traumatic treatment,
 leaving more enamel present in the tooth after treatment.

\begin_layout Standard
The Kappa coefficient was applied to analyze the concordance index of the
 diagnosis of the professionals selected for each examination modality separatel
y, and the OCT method demonstrated perfect agreement between the evaluators,
 while there was a substantial agreement for the clinical and radiographic
 examinations.
 This indicates that OCT, besides be a good tool for diagnosis can be consistent
ly interpreted by well trained dentists.
 However, it was not possible to use a statistical test to compare the clinical,
 X-ray and OCT examinations simultaneously.
 The first method (clinical observation) is only able to see defects at
 external surfaces; radiographic methods image across the tooth, but the
 resulting image inherently overlays the buccal and lingual 14 surfaces
 making it difficult to detect and determine internal problems.
 OCT can produce two dimensional and cross-sectional images, allowing the
 observer to see external and internal details, without overlap of structures,
 being able to accurately locate the visualized structures.
 Thus teeth were visualized in different forms in each type of examination,
 but many of the minor defects (air bubbles, for example) only can be seen
 by OCT.
 However, all defects detected by clinical and X-ray examinations were also
 detected using the OCT protocol.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This study demonstrates that OCT is a powerful tool for the early detection
 of failures on restorations, through visualization of microleakages, internal
 fractures, superficial cracks and fissures, tooth demineralization under
 the restorative material and cervical adaptation of the restorations.
 Incipient lesions can be precisely located, their depth may be measured
 and their proximity to the dentin-enamel junction may be determined.
 The sensitivity of the OCT technique is sufficient such that details, including
 the use of different colors of resin composite used to increase the esthetic
 aspect of a restoration, can be identified due to the slightly different
 scattering properties (see figure 7).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As dentists are used to dental radiographs for diagnostic purposes, OCT
 imaging, which shows similar dental morphology, could be readily adopted
 [4] and, ideally, the number of conventional X-ray investigations would
 be reduced in order to minimize the patients exposure to ionizing radiation
 [13].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, it is necessary to recognize some limitations of OCT: the system
 has a small depth penetration, (1-3 mm in teeth), which is, however, adequate
 for enamel and even dentin visualization.
 This is partly because we chose to use light at 850nm in order to increase
 the contrast between areas with only slightly different scattering properties.
 The use of longer wavelength sources (around 1300nm), with some slight
 loss of 15 contrast, and hence sensitivity, may provide the best compromise
 between depth of imaging and sensitivity to minor alterations in structure.
 Furthermore, our current system does not allow the use of the technique
 in every tooth, just on incisors and canines.
 Thus for this first stage of our studies applying OCT in vivo, we only
 assessed anterior teeth, for two reasons: incisors and canines are the
 teeth that require better esthetic restorative procedures, and the unavailabili
ty of a handpiece probe, presently under development, to reach the posterior
 dentition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The time acquisition for each image is less than one second; so considering
 that we performed one image at every 0.2 mm, and including the time to save
 the images, the complete examination takes between 2-4 minutes, depending
 of the tooth width.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some difficulties were found during the data collection of this study: the
 major of them was to control the production of saliva and subsequent patient
 movement, which tended to produce image artifacts.
 Thus was minimized by careful explanation to the patient and the use of
 the stabilization bar.
 A further complication was to undertake the examinations in patients presenting
 a maxillary overjet (an orthodontic condition in which the third incisor
 is ahead of the cervical third in the upper incisors, and thus the teeth
 appear to be inclined horizontally) – this problem was solved by requesting
 the patient to bow their head slightly but, in a long term, the solution
 is in the development of a handpiece probe.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The software in the current system does not permit the construction of volumetri
c three dimensional imaging generation that could present interesting visual
 effects and might provide the clinician, in the longer term, with novel
 and potentially useful views of the tooth.
 This is an area for future study and here we have presented the data in
 a manner which is familiar to the dental practitioner, as a 2 dimensional
 data set, though their experience of X-rays.

Further clinical studies covering cervical adaptation of aesthetics-facets
 and fixed crowns are currently underway.
 The high sensitivity of OCT to minor defects also opens up a further clinical
 question over which minor defects will progress to server complications
 and which may stay at the minor level.
 The development of such revised treatment protocols is beyond the scope
 of the present study but it is an area that will need to be investigated
 as OCT moves towards a standard diagnostic instrument in clinical practice,
 as is the case with any new technological advance.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compared to conventional radiography, OCT is a powerful tool for investigation
 of failures at the tooth-restoration interface.
 OCT is able to exactly visualize external and internal micrometric structures,
 not perceived by clinical examination or conventional radiography, proving
 its superiority as a technique for early diagnosis of restoration failures
 and prevention of recurrent caries.
 However, because of the low penetration depth of OCT, conventional radiography
 imaging may not be totally substituted.
 This was a qualitative study applying OCT in dental clinics; we used convention
al X-Ray, the most widely used modality of imaging for diagnostic assessment
 in dental clinics, and the clinical examination as the comparison for our
 study.
 We analyzed the differences between the modalities of exams mentioned above
 and the advantages and limitations of conventional radiography and OCT
 examinations.
 Besides other applications of the OCT technique in vivo, further complementary
 studies are under-way to determine dental composites failures in a quantitative
 manner, as well as their size or extent.

The platform in which optic on chip works consists in the use of a high
 index of refraction material surrounded by a material with lower index
 of refraction to guide light in the higher refrative index material using
 the total internal reflection.
 We call a slab waveguide when a higher refractive index medium is cladded
 by a lower index medium in only dimension.
 Light that is guided in the higher index material can be treated a two
 dimensional wave.
 In this regime, knowledge of free space optics can be applied to design
 devices.
 Components like, lenses, mirrors, concave mirrors, prisms, gratings can
 be readliy visualized[citations][pictures].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another component is wire waveguide, where a high index of refraction material
 is surrounded by lower index material in two dimension.
 This structure transport light like electrons on copper wire.
 This structure is widely used as fiber optics, where system built on fiber
 optics can implemented on chip waveguides.

Detectors

\begin_layout Standard
Detector are the conversor from photonics to electronics.
 As with light sources the material which the detector is made of needs
 to be integrated to the rest of the circuit.
 The most used detector type relies on the excitation of electrons from
 the valence band to the conduction band of a semiconductor material, by
 the photons to be detected.
 But other physical effects can be used to make detector.
 [exemples]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Semiconductor detector, nevertheless, are the most used due to its bandwidth,
 limited by the electron mobility which allows bandwidth of [numbers for].
 Sensitivity, (operating in avalanche mode single photons can be detected).
 Simplicity, in metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) the only thing needed is
 the detecting semiconductor material and the metal contacts.
 Depoing the endpoints of the detector creating a PIN structure will allow
 eliminate the need for an external voltage drive.

A diffraction grating may be defined as any arrangement which imposes on
 an incident wave a periodic variation of amplitude of phase, or both.
 We may characterize any particular grating by its 
\emph on

\emph default

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, defined as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let a transparent or semitransparent object (not necessarily periodic) cover
 a portion of a fictitious reference plane 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi\eta$
\end_inset

, and let it be illuminated by a plane monochromatic wave incident in a
 direction specified by the direction cosines 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Fig illustrates the arrangement, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

-axis being perpendicular to the plane of he drawing.
 If no object were present, the disturbance in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi,\eta$
\end_inset

-plane would be represented by the function 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}\left(\xi,\eta\right)=A\exp\left[ik\left(l_{0}\xi+m_{0}\eta\right)\right]$
\end_inset

, the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp\left(-i\omega t\right)$
\end_inset

 being, as usual, omitted.
 Because of the presence of the object disturbance will be modified and
 may be represented by some other function, which we denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $V\left(\xi,\eta\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\emph on
transmission function
\emph default
 of the object is then defined as
\begin_inset Formula \[
F\left(\xi,\eta\right)=\frac{V\left(\xi,\eta\right)}{V_{0}\left(\xi,\eta\right)}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 depends, not only on 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 but also on the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(l_{0},m_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

 of illumination.
 The transmission function is in general complex, since both the amplitude
 and the phase of the light may be altered on the passing through the object.
 In the special case when the object alters the amplitude but no the phase
 of the incident wave (i.e.
 if arg 
\begin_inset Formula $F\equiv0$
\end_inset

), we speak of an 
\emph on
amplitude object
\emph default
; if it alters the phase but not the amplitude (i.
 e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|F\right|=1$
\end_inset

) we speak of a 
\emph on
phase object
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we are concerned with reflected light rather than with light that is
 transmitted by an object, it is more appropriate to speak of a 
\emph on
reflection function
\emph default
, defined in a similar way, the only difference being that the reference
 plane is on the same side of the object as the incident light.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|V/V_{0}\right|$
\end_inset

Let us now consider a one-dimensional grating consisting of

 Let the

Hence
\begin_inset Formula \[

\begin_layout Standard
Before discussing the implications of this basic formula we note that according
 to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: Up"

\end_inset

.
 The light distribution is the same as that due to a set of coherent secondary
 sources each characterized by the same amplitude function 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\right|$
\end_inset

 and with phases that differ form each other by integral multiples of 
\begin_inset Formula $kdp$
\end_inset

.
 To see the significance of this phase difference consider two corresponding
 points 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in the neighboring grooves of the grating.
 Since the effect of the grating is to impress a periodic variation onto
 the incident wave, it follows that the path difference between the light
 arriving a 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and at 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is the same as in the absence of the grating, i.e.
 it is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $AK=d\sin\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 denoting the foot of the perpendicular from 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 on to the ray incident at 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Further, the light path from 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 exceeds the light path from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $BL=d\sin\theta$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 being the foot of the perpendicular from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 on to the ray diffracted at 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta.$
\end_inset

 Hence the total path difference between light arriving at the distant point
 of observation form corresponding points in two neighboring grooves is
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
BL-AK=d\left(\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}\right)=dp,\label{eq: path difference}\end{equation}

 Between theses principal maxima there are weak secondary maxima (see fig
 8.19a), the first secondary maximum being only a few percent of the principal
 maximum when 
\begin_inset Formula $N$

 The maxima are separated by points of zero intensity at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=kdp/2=\pm n\pi/N$

 in directions given by
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}

The function

\end_inset

 and that on both sides of the maximum if falls off slowly in comparison
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $H$

 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $I\left(p\right)$
\end_inset

 will have the general form o the sharp maxima near the directions 
\begin_inset Formula $p=m\lambda/d$
\end_inset

 Since these directions (except for 
\begin_inset Formula $m=0$

Returning to the general case, it is evident that if the width of each groove
 is very small, of the order of a wavelength (as is often the case in practice)
 the formula derived on the basis of Kirchhoff's approximation, can evidently
 no longer be expected to hold.
 In such cases more refined considerations must be make to determine the
 detailed distribution of the intensity.
 We may, however, expect that the main qualitative features indicated by
 our elementary theory, namely the existence of sharp maxima whose positions
 are substantially determined by the interference function 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

, remain even when the grooves are very narrow, provided, that the intensity
 function of a single period varies slowly in an interval of the order 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p=\lambda/d$
\end_inset

 Let us now consider the resolution that may be attained with a grating.
 The separation between a primary maximum of order 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and a neighbouring minimum is, according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Assuming that the lines of wavelength

\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p=\Delta'p$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}

th order we have, according to, that 
\begin_inset Formula $d\left(\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}\right)=m\lambda$

\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\lambda}{\Delta\lambda}=\frac{Nd\left|\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}\right|}{\lambda}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 this implies that

 It is to be noted that since

From the resolving power equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 so as to minimize the device size for a given resolution.
 Unfortunatelly, the grating equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:grating equation"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p\equiv\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}=\frac{m\lambda}{Nd}$
\end_inset

, we see that it is possible for light from to different wavelength in different
e diffraction orders to be diffracted to the same angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

, sufficing that 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
m_{i}\lambda_{i}=m_{j}\lambda_{j}\]

\end_inset

for 
\begin_inset Formula $i\neq j$
\end_inset

, so for example light diffracted in order 1 at wavelength 1500 nm is diffracted
 in the same direction as light diffracted from order 2 wavelength 750 nm.
 To avoid this ambiguity, it is of interest to know when this condition
 happens.
 From the grating equation we see that

\begin_inset Formula $Nd$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $Nd/2$

 and so on.
 We see then, that for order 1 the range

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[

It is worth noting that althought 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{Cm}$
\end_inset

 is in the middle of the spectral range 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\lambda_{m}$
\end_inset

 the wavelenths are not linearly distributed along the angle range that
 it is diffracted to, and therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{Cm}$
\end_inset

 is not located at the center of the angle range of the

 [Graph]We see then that the free spectral range depends inverselly with
 the diffraction order used, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\Delta\lambda_{m}=\frac{\lambda_{Cm}}{m+0.5}.\label{eq:FSR}\end{equation}

This fact, ties to use the a maximum operating diffraction order to the

The previous exposition on diffraction grating does not change on the medium
 in which the device is built on.
 But since we are interested in spectrometeres integrated on chips, it worth
 lifting the characteristics of this device.
 From this point two features stand out as very different from regular free
 space spectrometer.
 First is that light is always guided in a slab waveguide, the confinement
 of light in one dimension change the nature of the system from a 3 dimensional
 to bi-dimensional one.
 As this fact causes the light power to decay with the inverse of the distance
 as it moves away from the source.
 The other diference is the change of the dispersion due to both the material
 and the confinement effect.
 The outcome of this is that for all the results in the previous section,
 the wavelength variable that needs to be considered is the effective wavelenght
 in the medium.

 As shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, the light to be analyzed is shined through the entrance slit.
 Due to diffraction, the light fan out as it propagates to the collimating
 concave mirror where light is collimated and reflected in the direction
 of the diffraction grating.
 The diffraction grating then, deviates light from each different wavelength
 (optical frequencies) into different angles following the equation

 A focusing concave mirror focus the light coming from the diffraction grating

The function of the entrance slit is to filter spatial optical modes that
 are inputed into the system.
 For best filtering the slit has to transmit only a single spatial mode.
 This is achieved by making the slit width of the order of the light wavelength.
 Decreasing slit width will increase the beam spread angle, as depicted
 in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:different slits"

\end_inset

, for a chosen final beam width this will allow the collimating concave
 mirror to placed nearer to the slit decreasing the device size.
 However, decrease the slit width will also decrease the fraction of transmitted
 light.
 and therefore, lowering the device sensitivity.

 Alternatively we can say that light in different k in the k space into
 different points in the coordinate space.
 Clearly, the size of the focusing mirror must be such that it collects
 most of the light coming from the diffraction grating.
 This means that it must be bigger than the beam size plus account for the
 spread of different wavelengths.

A detector is placed at a point in the focus plan to measure the light power.
 Optimum detector size is of the order of the entrance slit width, limited
 also by the resolving power of the diffraction grating.
 Placing a exit slit in the focus plane followed by a detector, can be used
 as an alternative for the slit size detector.

The design consists in the use of a concave diffraction grating of radius
 2R.
 The entrance and exit slits positions are located in a circle of radius
 R tangent to the diffraction grating sphere.
 Or more precisely tangent to one of the equator of the diffraction grating
 sphere.
 For optimum area usage, the equator should be perpendicular to the diffraction
 grating grooves and passing through the grating center.

, this limitation can be overcome by replacing the grating grooves by an
 array of waveguides.
 To understand how the introduction of waveguide help it is necessary to
 understand more generally what diffraction order is.
 We say that certain diffraction peak is of order 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 if each wave from the set that was constructively interfered to form the
 interference peak is delayed from one another of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 periods.
 On traditional ruled surface diffraction gratings, wavefront from different
 period are made to interfere by making the wave travel different path lengths
 by taking path that deviates from the equal angle reflection.

By guiding light through waveguide it is possible to increase the difference
 of path length among different waveguides, achieved by only changing the
 waveguides lengths.
 Each waveguide of the waveguide array would function like a groove in the
 diffraction grating, but since waveguide length is only limited by its
 intrinsic loss, the difference of path length can be on the order of hundreds
 of wavelength, giving raise to grating that operate of diffraction order
 of also hundreds.

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately there is a drawback of increasing diffraction order, the free
 spectral range as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:FSR"

\end_inset

, decreases with the inverse of the of the diffraction order.
 For instance, an arrayed waveguide grating working on diffraction order
 100 at wavelength 1500 nm would have a FSR of only 15 nm.
 Although this range is useful for fiber optics telecommunications, this
 bandwidth is too small for most spectroscopy application, optical coherence
 tomography or ultra-fast oscilloscope[refs].
 Since we want to achieve a wide spectrum range, this architecture is not
 fit for us.

On section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, it was assumed that the whole grating was uniformly illuminated.
 In practice, this case not always occurs.
 Light source is normally a collimated light from a slit, pin hole or fiber
 optics, where for best resolution, single mode output should pass through.
 In those cases the tranversal power profile is better modeled by a gaussian
 than by a square profile, see figure

 To ajust the resolving power equation

 to account for the Gaussian profile illumination we have to alter the squared
 illumination assumption in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula \[

Rowland ghosts are spurious lines seen in some grating spectra that result
 from periodic errors in the spacing of the grooves.
 These are usually located symmetrically with respect to each strong spectral

 error, and with an intensity that depends on the amplitude of this error.

\begin_layout Standard
The resolving power equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: resolving power"

\end_inset

 states that the resolution of a diffraction grating depends linearly with
 the wavelength.
 Unfortunatelly, that relation is only valid for plane waves.
 To use segregation capability of the diffraction grating, it is necessary
 to have a source of plane waves and to measure the light power that go
 to different direction after diffraction from the grating.
 Sources and detector are space localized endpoints.
 But employing lenses, it is possible to convert a space localized mode
 to a angle localized mode., as discussed on the Czerny-Turner configuration
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Czerny-Turner"

\end_inset

.
 This conversion, however, is not perfect.
 In geometrical optics terms, this means that rays that enter parallel in
 a lens (or any other focusin device) does no converge to a single point
 after the lens and with the fase arriving at exaclty the same time(picture?).
 Integrating the lens into the grating, as done in Rowland configuration
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, does not readily eliminate the problem, but its application together with
 the potencial to fabricate designs with freedom to choose any geometry

 It is worth emphasizing that the path length evaluation should consider

The integration of silicon photonics and electronics in a CMOS compatible

 demultiplexer (WDM) integrated with detectors and electronic amplifiers.
 Most silicon-on-insulator (SOI) WDMs with 1 nm channel spacing typically
 cover a spectral range of only 10 nm.
 The small spectral range in typical WDMs is due to the use of arrayed waveguide

 designs where large grating orders are employed to achieve small channel
 spacing which comes with the cost of free spectral range.
 It is possible to increase the spectral range by lowering the grating order
 and adding more waveguides to compensate, but this increases the overall
 chip size.
 Furthermore, due to the high index contrast of the silicon photonics platform,
 the achievable resolution depends on very fine control of the AWG waveguide
 dimensions.

 This design is more fabrication tolerant since light is propagating in
 a slab where the only dimension that needs to be controlled is the slab
 thickness.
 It is also more suitable to work at a low grating order because light diffracts

Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We designed a WDM that uses a Rowland design with one stigmatic point correction.
 The system was designed so that stigmatic point was located at the central
 waveguide of the 21 output waveguide array.
 The central wavelength was chosen to be 1500 nm and the diffraction order
 was 10.
 The Rowland circle was chosen to be 750 μm.
 The designed grating contains 340 grooves.
 The resulting free spectral range was estimated to be 117 nm, and the groove
 spacing approximately 4 μm.
 The input and output waveguide apertures were 1.4 μm.
 A reference waveguide was placed next to the spectrometer so that the transmiss
ion efficiency could be estimated.

\begin_layout Subsection
Operating wavelength
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the readly avaibility of testing equipment operating at 1460-1610
 nm range we decided to design the system to operate somewhere at this range.
 Germanium detector have a peak detection at 1500 nm so we decided to design
 the spectrometer operating range centered at 1500 nm.

 The system is capable of writing using only beam deflecton on an area (denomina

 By moving the sample to be written (process called as

) one is capable of writing a whole 5x5 inches mask.
 Unfortunatelly due to the extreme precision required, it is difficult to
 align the boders of neighboring fields perfectly, with the system working
 its best alignments of 10 nm are possible, though achieving this kind of
 precision is requires a good amount of trials and experience, alignments
 of 50 nm are more routinelly achieved.
 In order to avoid errors in the spectrometer grating during stitching we
 limited the size of the grating in order of it to fit in a single 1x1 mm
 field, which meant placing the grating along the diagonal of the field,
 which, ignoring the grating curvature, gaves us a grating size of 1.4 mm.

 The diffraction grating spectrometer contains 25 channels with spacing

 To match the ring resonator FSR to the DG spectrometer channel spacing
 we use an 83.5 m radius ring with waveguide cross-section of 450 x 250 nm.
 The FSR changes with wavelength according to

We measured the performance of our WDM and observed -10 dB crosstalk and
 1 nm channel spacing across 21 channels.
 As shown in Fig.
 2, a relatively flat transmission spectrum was obtained.
 This result was measured by inserting light from a tunable laser and measuring
 the power from the output waveguides.
 A fiber polarization controller was used to set the input polarization
 to TE and a polarizer was placed between the chip output and the detector
 to filter out any TM polarized light.
 An insertion loss of -10 dB was estimated by comparing to the transmission
 through the reference waveguide.
 This can be attributed to Fresnel reflection between the Si-SiO2 interfaces
 at the grating groove facet and can be reduced by coating the grating facets
 with a reflective metal.

 Since the free spectral range is greater the 100 nm, by adding additional

How can we use resonators to make spectrometer.
 An array of resonators can be used.
 But fabrication limits prevent its use without requiring individually tuning
 each resonator.
 Grating spectrometers uses a lot of space.
 Is there a middle way.
 Yes! we can use small free spectral range resonators and a grating spectrometer.
 The device described in this chapter was published on optics express and
 presented on the Conference of Lasers and Electro-Optics 2010 (CLEO) as
 a invited paper and received and honorable mention in the Maiman Student

Device Theory

\begin_layout Standard
The principle of operation consists of using a resonator to pre-filter the
 light to be analyzed by a diffraction grating spectrometer as shown in
 figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Fig:resonator-enhanced-principle"

\end_inset

.
 The resonator transmits only the resonant wavelengths.
 A diffraction grating spectrometer is then used to route light from different
 resonances into distinct output channels.
 The net effect is that the final resonator and diffraction grating spectrometer
 line width will be equal to the resonator line width.
 On silicon ring resonators cladded with silicon dioxide, line width as
 narrow as 30 pm are routinely achieved[ref].
 Therefore, enabling the possibility of creating 30 pm resolution spectrometers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To achieve this, the resonator and the spectrometer must be designed so
 that the channel spacing of the diffraction grating spectrometer matches
 the ring resonator FSR.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The spectrometer must be designed so that each output channel only allows
 to transmit a single resonance.
 Therefore the spectrometer channel spacing must be equal to the resonator
 FSR.

Testing

\begin_layout Standard
We measure the device transmission spectrum by coupling laser light from
 a tunable laser into the input waveguide using a lensed fiber and measuring
 the transmitted power as a function of wavelength.
 The input light is TE polarized and the output light is collected using
 a microscope objective and filtered for the TE polarization before detection.
 We achieve a channel FWHM of 0.05 nm across 10 different channels of the
 composed ring and EDG spectrometer, which represents a decrease in the
 channel width by 10 times compared with the DG spectrometer alone.
 This channel width corresponds to a quality factor of Q = 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda/\Delta\lambda$
\end_inset

= 30000.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 3(b) shows the device transmission.
 The transmission is normalized to the ring through port power level to
 eliminate coupling losses.
 The device insertion loss varies between -18 and -23 dB, where -10 dB is
 due to the Fresnel reflection of the diffraction grating and can be eliminated
 by coating it with a metal or using Bragg reflectors 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Brouckaert:2008p108"

\end_inset

.
 Other losses are attributed to stitching in the waveguide definition during
 e-beam lithography.
 A small mismatch between the resonator FSR (0.97 nm) and the DG spectrometer
 channel spacing (1 nm) cause a misalignment between the resonance and the
 DG spectrometer channel that builds up from one channel to the next in
 a Vernier effect.
 The outcome is a misalignment between the 11th spectrometer channel and
 the 11th ring resonance.
 Therefore only 10 of the 25 channels on the DG spectrometer are used.
 This issue can be eliminated by more detailed characterization of fabrication.

Serializing devices either spatially or in time can increase the spectrometer
 channel density.
 The space serialization approach consists of using multiple combined ring-DG
 spectrometers, so that the input of a spectrometer is connected to the
 through port of the previous device, as shown in Fig.
 4(a).
 The peak wavelength of each spectrometer is shifted relative to the others.
 The number of devices needed in order to achieve the a spectral density
 where the channels are separated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\lambda_{FWHM}$
\end_inset

, is equal to the DG spectrometer channel width divided by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\lambda_{FWHM}$
\end_inset

.
 In spite of the area increase, this approach is still more compact than
 using a traditional diffraction grating spectrometer since in this proposed
 approach the area increases linearly with resolution as opposed to quadratic
 in traditional DGs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In time serialization, Fig.
 4(b), only a single combined spectrometer is used and the output spectrum
 is measured several times.
 In each measurement the device transmission spectrum is shifted.
 Notice that this approach also requires active tuning of the ring and the
 EDG spectrometer.
 By applying the time serialization technique we were able to reduce the
 channel spacing from 0.97 nm to 0.097 nm, and were able to measure 100 channels
 using the device.
\end_layout

A zoom in on the series of channels is depicted in Fig.

 Figure 6 (b) shows a density plot where each horizontal line corresponds
 to the transmission spectrum of each channel.
 Notice that the overlap of the residual transmission from the DG spectrometer
 with the neighboring resonances can be seen in the side diagonal lines,
 and their transmissions are at least 10 dB lower than the peak (main diagonal
 line).

Effect of transmission spectrum lineshape
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect that the transmission lineshape causes on the output spectrum
 is that the final measured spectrum is the convolution of the real spectrum
 with the channel transmission spectrum.
 The basic consquence is the limitation of the spectroemter resolution.
 For systems where the desired data is the Fourier transform of the output,
 such as optical coherence tomography and ultra fast osciloscope, the transmissi
on spectrum linshape will cause a roll of as the frequency increases in
 the Fourier transmorm graph.
 This is due to the

If the aperture

 is much smaller than 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, then we can consider that 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos\left(r,m\right)$
\end_inset

 does not vary a lot in the integral, therefore we can pull it outside the
 integral, which convert the integral to 
\begin_inset Formula $U\left(P\right)$
\end_inset

 We therefore can simplify the equations to
\begin_inset Formula \[
\begin{cases}
U\left(P\right)=\int_{\mathbb{Q}}\frac{e^{\text{i}kr}}{\sqrt{kr}}\left[\frac{ikU\left(Q\right)}{2}\cos\left(r,n\right)-\frac{\partial U\left(Q\right)}{\partial n}\right]dS\\
