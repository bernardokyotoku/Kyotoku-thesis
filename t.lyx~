Consider the interferometer shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
 To simplify the analisys, ignore the light polarization and dispersion
 effects.
 A light source emits a radiation whose electric field shine upon a beamspliter
 e described by 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{0}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This light is devided and a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 of its power is directed to mirror 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 with reflectivity 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{s}$
\end_inset

.
 The light is reflected and returns to the beam spliter, where a fraction
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1-D\right)$
\end_inset

 of its power goes to the detector.
 Similarly, in the other interferometer arm, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1-D\right)$
\end_inset

 of the light emited by the light source is redirected to the mirror 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{r}$
\end_inset

, which is reflected and returns to the beamspliter, where a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 of this light is redirected back to the detector.
 The electric field at the detector can be decribed by
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
E_{s}=\sqrt{K_{0}}E_{0}\left(t-\tau_{a}\right)+\sqrt{K_{r}}E_{0}\left(t-\tau_{r}\right),\label{eq:Simplest Field equation}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{i}=R_{i}D\left(1-D\right)$
\end_inset

 is the light power fraction that is shined to the detector and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the time the light takes to go from the beamspliter to the mirror 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and back.

The relationship between the output light intensity 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle I\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and the mean electric field is:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left\langle I\right\rangle =\left\langle \frac{\left|E\left(t\right)\right|^{2}}{2\eta_{0}}\right\rangle ,\label{eq:intensity field relation}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{0}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu_{0}}{\varepsilon_{0}}}$
\end_inset

 is the free space impedance.
 Using 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Simplest Field equation"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:intensity field relation"

\end_inset

, we get the intensity at the detector as been
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left\langle I\right\rangle =\left\langle I_{\text{DC}}\right\rangle +\sqrt{K_{s}K_{r}}\Re\left(\Gamma\left(\tau_{s,a}\right)\right)\label{eq:michelson output intensity equation}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{r,s}=\tau_{s}-\tau_{r}$
\end_inset

.
 We define the autocorrelation function for beam electric field as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Gamma\left(\tau\right)=\frac{E\left(t-\tau\right)E^{*}\left(t\right)}{\eta_{0}}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle I_{\text{DC}}\right\rangle =\sum_{j}K_{j}\left\langle I_{0}\right\rangle ,\]

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle I_{0}\right\rangle =\left\langle \frac{\left|E_{0}\left(t\right)\right|^{2}}{2\eta_{0}}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is the mean light intensity that leaves the source, which in this case
 is constant.
 More specifically, it is of interest that the light source should be stationary
 in the wide sense, which means
\end_layout

 Physically, the definition tell how great is the information

 due to noise.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Noise sources
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The noise shown here in the detection band used can be considered white

 The outcome of that is that the variance of the noise signals sum is equal

Noise due to the quantization of light and electric current.
 The quantity of photons arriving at the detector in a sampling interval
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

 is not constant, even if the power of the light source is.
 The distribuition of the number of photons hitting the detector as a poissonian
 lineshape, whose width is equal to the mean number of photons.
 In addition to that, the photoelectron generation ocurs with a probability
 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$

 It can be shown, that the photoelectron current has a variance
\begin_inset Formula \[

Relative intensity noise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Relative intensity noise (RIN) are noise that grows linearly with the mea
 n photo-current power.
 A few examples include the optical source power fluctuations.
 The noise spectral density can be model with a white noise over the band
 of interest.
 Therefore, the variance of this noise can be described as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sigma_{RIN}^{2}=e\gamma\left\langle i\right\rangle ^{2}B,\]

\end_inset

 where the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

 In practice it is possible to remove this noise using a balanced detection
 system.
 We therefore will not take this noise into consideration in the final calculati

 da informação do espectro da luz retroespalhada.
 Essa foi a primeira demonstração do conceito de tomografia por coerência
 óptica no domínio de Fourier.
 Em 2002, Wojtkowski et al.
 [39] demonstraram a capacidade de obter imagens da retina humana usando
 uma TCO no domínio Fourier, derrubando o ceticismo corrente em relação
 à funcionalidade da técnica.
 Estudos posteriores [17] demonstraram a superioridade da TCO no domínio
 de Fourier em relação à TCO temporal com relação à sensibilidade, desviando
 o foco de diversos grupos de que trabalham com TCO para esta modalidade

Before showing more rigorous derivation of we will show a more intuitive
 picturo on how frequency domain OCT reconstruct it image.
 Let a Michelson interferometer ilustrated on 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Michelson-interferometer-2"

\end_inset

 and described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Michelson-Interferometer"

\end_inset

.
 It was show in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Michelson-Interferometer"

\end_inset

 that the light intensity in the interferometer output is described by
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle I\right\rangle =\left\langle I_{0}\right\rangle +\frac{\sqrt{K_{r}K_{s}}}{\eta_{0}}\cos\left(2\pi\nu\tau_{r,s}\right).\]

\end_inset

Notice that the equation has a dual behavior relative to optical frequency
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and the time delay 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 Usually, it is easiear to vary the interferometer arm length keeping the
 optical frequency (or wavelength) constant and observe the light intensity
 at the interferometer output.
 We will then see interference fringes as graph on figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:freqGraphSimple"

\end_inset

.
 But if we keep the arms length diference constant and equal 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta l=c\tau/2$
\end_inset

, we can rewrite equation X as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle I\right\rangle =\left\langle I_{0}\right\rangle +\frac{\sqrt{K_{r}K_{s}}}{\eta_{0}}\cos\left(2\pi\frac{2\Delta l}{c}\nu\right).\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the oscilation period in inversly proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta l$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, if we know the period of the intensity oscilation in optical
 frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\nu$
\end_inset

, the we can calculate the diference of optical pathlength between the interfero
meter arms, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta l=\frac{c}{2\Delta\nu}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If instead of a mirror we put dielectric sample in place of a sample mirror,
 as show in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:InterferometerBiLayer"

\end_inset

, instead of getting a simple intensity oscilation, we will get a superposition
 of several senoids described by the equation below
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle I\right\rangle =\left\langle I_{0}\right\rangle \left[1+F_{r,1}\cos\left(2\pi\tau_{r,1}\nu\right)+F_{r,2}\cos\left(2\pi\tau_{r,2}\nu\right)+F_{1,2}\cos\left(2\pi\tau_{1,2}\nu\right)\right].\]

\end_inset

The second and the second term in the braces are related to the interference
 between the light from the reference mirror and the interfaces 1 and 2.
 The fourth term is due to the interference of the interfaces 1 and 2 between
 themselves.
 As can be seen by figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:graphics interference bi-layer"

\end_inset

, it is difficult to identify the frequencies of each harmonic associated
 with the interference of light coming from two interfaces.
 However, we can identify the contribution of each harmonic by taking the
 fourier transform of the power spectrum as illustrated in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ft graph interferometer bi-layer"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The presence peak due to the interference between the two interfaces of
 the sample are called 
\emph on
self-interference
\emph default
, and as can be seen, it creates reconstruction artifacts that obstruct
 the reconstructed image.
 However, note that the distance of the peak is equal to the sample thickness,
 and is independent of the distance between the interfaces and the reference
 distance.
 Therfore, if the distance of the sample surface to the reference is greater
 than the sample thickness, all peaks after the position 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta l_{1,2}$
\end_inset

 are free of the these artifacts.
 In the following section we will show other methods to supress these artifacts.

 Uma fonte de luz de baixa coerência emite uma radi- ação, cujo campo elétrico

 A luz é dividida no acoplador de fibra óptica, onde uma fração D da potência

 A luz então retorna ao acoplador onde (1−D), e vai para o espectrômetro.
 Analogamente, no braço da amostra, (1 − D) da luz emitida pela fonte incidem
 sobre a amostra, onde uma fração Ri que foi retro-refletida ou retro-espalhada
 na camada i retorna à fibra e uma porção D dessa se encaminha para o espectrôme

 O campo elétrico na entrada do espec- trômetro é descrito por

The principle of FD OCT is based on calculating the auto-correlation function
 of the output light from its power spectrum density.
 Acording to the Wiener-Khinchin theorem the auto-correlation of a function
 and its power spectral density are related by a Fourier Transform.
 Therefore the, power spectral density at the interferometer output is
\begin_inset Formula \[
G\left(\nu\right)=G_{0}\left(\nu\right)\left[\left(K_{r}+\sum_{i}K_{i}\right)+2\sum_{i}K_{r,i}\cos\left(2\pi\nu\Delta\tau_{r,i}\right)+2\sum_{i\ne j}K_{i,j}\cos\left(2\pi\nu\Delta\tau_{i,j}\right)\right],\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the light source PSD.
 We see that the interferometer output PSD is composed of interference fringes
 whose frequencies grows with the delays 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau_{a,b}$
\end_inset

, and is modulated by a envelope equal toe the input light PSD.

The modulus of the auto-correlation of the inteferometer output light can
 be calculated from the output PSD.
 But as stated before we are only interested in the second term of the auto-corr
elation function.
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\Gamma_{2}\right|=\sum_{i}K_{r,i}\left|\Gamma_{0}\left(\tau+\Delta\tau_{r,i}\right)\right|,\]

Several methods were developed to extract the this term from the auto-correlatio
n function.
 Each method having it own virtues and shortcomings in terms of processing
 power, additional equipment, sensitivity to sample motion (relevant for
 in vivo imaging).
 We describe a selection of the methods below.

This method removes the DC peak of the reconstructed image.
 The basic principle relies on filtering out any component that does no

The platform in which optic on chip works consists in the use of a high
 index of refraction material surrounded by a material with lower index
 of refraction to guide light in the higher refrative index material using
 the total internal reflection.
 We call a slab waveguide when a higher refractive index medium is cladded
 by a lower index medium in only dimension.
 Light that is guided in the higher index material can be treated a two
 dimensional wave.
 In this regime, knowledge of free space optics can be applied to design
 devices.
 Components like, lenses, mirrors, concave mirrors, prisms, gratings can
 be readliy visualized[citations][pictures].

Detector are the conversor from photonics to electronics.
 As with light sources the material which the detector is made of needs
 to be integrated to the rest of the circuit.
 The most used detector type relies on the excitation of electrons from
 the valence band to the conduction band of a semiconductor material, by
 the photons to be detected.
 But other physical effects can be used to make detector.

Semiconductor detector, nevertheless, are the most used due to its bandwidth,
 limited by the electron mobility which allows bandwidth of [numbers for].
 Sensitivity, (operating in avalanche mode single photons can be detected).
 Simplicity, in metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) the only thing needed is
 the detecting semiconductor material and the metal contacts.
 Depoing the endpoints of the detector creating a PIN structure will allow
 eliminate the need for an external voltage drive.

 If no object were present, the disturbance in the

\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}\left(\xi,\eta\right)=A\exp\left[ik\left(l_{0}\xi+m_{0}\eta\right)\right]$

 Because of the presence of the object disturbance will be modified and
 may be represented by some other function, which we denote by

 The

In general 
\begin_inset Formula $F$

\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 but also on the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(l_{0},m_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

 of illumination.
 The transmission function is in general complex, since both the amplitude
 and the phase of the light may be altered on the passing through the object.
 In the special case when the object alters the amplitude but no the phase
 of the incident wave (i.e.
 if arg 
\begin_inset Formula $F\equiv0$
\end_inset

), we speak of an 
\emph on

\emph default
; if it alters the phase but not the amplitude (i.

\begin_inset Formula $\left|F\right|=1$
\end_inset

) we speak of a

\begin_layout Standard
If we are concerned with reflected light rather than with light that is
 transmitted by an object, it is more appropriate to speak of a

 is practically unity for points outside the geometrical shadow (whose boundary

 If the portion outside the shadow region is covered by an opaque screen,
 the arrangements act as a diffracting aperture A with a nonuniform pupil

Let us now consider a one-dimensional grating consisting of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 parallel grooves of arbitrary profile, ruled on one surface of a plan-parallel
 glass plate.
 Let the 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi,\eta$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 being the direction of the grooves and let 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 be the period in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume that the direction of propagation of the wave incident upon the grating
 is in the plane of the figure, making an angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $O\zeta$
\end_inset

, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 denote the angle which 
\begin_inset Formula $O\zeta$
\end_inset

 makes with the line joining a very distant point of observation P with
 the grating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As before we set 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{o}=\sin\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $l=\sin\theta$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p=l-l_{0}=\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 The complex amplitude at 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is then immediately obtained from, where the integrand must be multiplied
 by the transmission function 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 of one periodic element.
 We may set 
\begin_inset Formula $q=0$
\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset Formula \[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\xi_{n}=nd, & \eta_{n}=0 & \left(n=0,1,\ldots,N-1\right)\end{array}.\]

We the obtain
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
U\left(p\right)=U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}e^{-ikndp}=U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\frac{1-e^{-iNkdp}}{1-e^{-kdp}},\label{eq: Up}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)=C\int_{A}\! F\left(\xi\right)e^{-ikp\xi}\, d\xi.\label{eq: diffraction envelope}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence
\begin_inset Formula \[
I\left(p\right)=\left|U\left(p\right)\right|^{2}=\frac{\left(1-e^{-Nkdp}\right)}{\left(1-e^{-kdp}\right)}\cdot\frac{\left(1-e^{Nkdp}\right)}{\left(1-e^{kdp}\right)}\left|U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\right|^{2}=\frac{1-\cos Nkdp}{1-\cos kdp}I^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right),\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $I^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)=\left|U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 If we introduce the function
\begin_inset Formula \[
H\left(N,x\right)=\left(\frac{\sin Nx}{\sin x}\right)^{2},\]

\end_inset

 the formula 5 for the intensity may be written as
\begin_inset Formula \[
I\left(p\right)=H\left(N,\frac{kdp}{2}\right)I^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right).\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before discussing the implications of this basic formula we note that according
 to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: Up"

\end_inset

.
 The light distribution is the same as that due to a set of coherent secondary
 sources each characterized by the same amplitude function 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\right|$
\end_inset

 and with phases that differ form each other by integral multiples of 
\begin_inset Formula $kdp$
\end_inset

.
 To see the significance of this phase difference consider two corresponding
 points 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in the neighboring grooves of the grating.
 Since the effect of the grating is to impress a periodic variation onto
 the incident wave, it follows that the path difference between the light
 arriving a 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and at 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is the same as in the absence of the grating, i.e.
 it is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $AK=d\sin\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 denoting the foot of the perpendicular from 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 on to the ray incident at 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Further, the light path from 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 exceeds the light path from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $BL=d\sin\theta$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 being the foot of the perpendicular from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 on to the ray diffracted at 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta.$
\end_inset

 Hence the total path difference between light arriving at the distant point
 of observation form corresponding points in two neighboring grooves is
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
BL-AK=d\left(\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}\right)=dp,\label{eq: path difference}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and the corresponding phase difference is 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi dp/\lambda=kdp$

\begin_inset Formula $N^{2}$

The integer 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 Between theses principal maxima there are weak secondary maxima (see fig
 8.19a), the first secondary maximum being only a few percent of the principal
 maximum when 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is large.
 The maxima are separated by points of zero intensity at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=kdp/2=\pm n\pi/N$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 in directions given by
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
p\equiv\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}=\frac{n\lambda}{Nd}\left(n=0,\pm1,\pm2,\ldots\right)\label{eq: grating secondary maxima}\end{equation}

The function 
\begin_inset Formula $I^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)$
\end_inset

 depends on the form of the grooves.
 Suppose that it has principal maximum for some direction 
\begin_inset Formula $p=p'$
\end_inset

 and that on both sides of the maximum if falls off slowly in comparison
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $H$

 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $I\left(p\right)$
\end_inset

 will have the general form o the sharp maxima near the directions 
\begin_inset Formula $p=m\lambda/d$
\end_inset

.
 Since these directions (except for 
\begin_inset Formula $m=0$

To illustrate these remarks let us consider a grating consisting of a succession
 of long equidistant slits, each of width

 if the width of each slit is small compared to 
\begin_inset Formula $d$

 a series of sharp, but progressively decreasing, maxima on either side

\begin_layout Standard
Returning to the general case, it is evident that if the width of each groove
 is very small, of the order of a wavelength (as is often the case in practice)
 the formula derived on the basis of Kirchhoff's approximation, can evidently
 no longer be expected to hold.
 In such cases more refined considerations must be make to determine the
 detailed distribution of the intensity.
 We may, however, expect that the main qualitative features indicated by
 our elementary theory, namely the existence of sharp maxima whose positions
 are substantially determined by the interference function 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

, remain even when the grooves are very narrow, provided, that the intensity
 function of a single period varies slowly in an interval of the order 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p=\lambda/d$
\end_inset

.
 Let us now consider the resolution that may be attained with a grating.
 The separation between a primary maximum of order 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and a neighbouring minimum is, according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Assuming that the lines of wavelength

\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p=\Delta'p$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}

\end_inset

th order we have, according to, that 
\begin_inset Formula $d\left(\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}\right)=m\lambda$

\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\lambda}{\Delta\lambda}=\frac{Nd\left|\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}\right|}{\lambda}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 this implies that 
\emph on

 between rays that are diffracted in the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 from the two extreme ends (separated by distance Nd) of the grating

 It is to be noted that since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}\right|$
\end_inset

 cannot exceed 2, the resolving power that can be attained with a grating
 of overall with 
\begin_inset Formula $w$

\begin_layout Standard
From the resolving power equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, we conclude that spectrometer should be operated on high diffraction order
 so as to minimize the device size for a given resolution.
 Unfortunatelly, the grating equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:grating equation"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p\equiv\sin\theta-\sin\theta_{0}=\frac{m\lambda}{Nd}$
\end_inset

, we see that it is possible for light from to different wavelength in different
e diffraction orders to be diffracted to the same angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

, sufficing that 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
m_{i}\lambda_{i}=m_{j}\lambda_{j}\]

\end_inset

for 
\begin_inset Formula $i\neq j$
\end_inset

, so for example light diffracted in order 1 at wavelength 1500 nm is diffracted
 in the same direction as light diffracted from order 2 wavelength 750 nm.
 To avoid this ambiguity, it is of interest to know when this condition
 happens.
 From the grating equation we see that 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

\begin_inset Formula $Nd$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $Nd/2$

 and so on.
 We see then, that for order 1 the range

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[

It is worth noting that althought 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{Cm}$
\end_inset

 is in the middle of the spectral range 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\lambda_{m}$
\end_inset

 the wavelenths are not linearly distributed along the angle range that
 it is diffracted to, and therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{Cm}$
\end_inset

 is not located at the center of the angle range of the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$

th order free spectral range.
 [Graph]We see then that the free spectral range depends inverselly with
 the diffraction order used, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\Delta\lambda_{m}=\frac{\lambda_{Cm}}{m+0.5}.\label{eq:FSR}\end{equation}

This fact, ties to use the a maximum operating diffraction order to the

The previous exposition on diffraction grating does not change on the medium
 in which the device is built on.
 But since we are interested in spectrometeres integrated on chips, it worth
 lifting the characteristics of this device.
 From this point two features stand out as very different from regular free
 space spectrometer.
 First is that light is always guided in a slab waveguide, the confinement
 of light in one dimension change the nature of the system from a 3 dimensional
 to bi-dimensional one.
 As this fact causes the light power to decay with the inverse of the distance
 as it moves away from the source.
 The other diference is the change of the dispersion due to both the material
 and the confinement effect.
 The outcome of this is that for all the results in the previous section,
 the wavelength variable that needs to be considered is the effective wavelenght
 in the medium.

Several architecture to build diffraction grating spectrometer exists.
 Due to lowest size resolution of the Rowland design, it was chosen to build
 the spectrometer.

Due to its modularity this architecture is probably the best to introduce
 spectrometers.
 It is composed of two slits, two concave mirrors and a diffraction grating.
 As shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, the light to be analyzed is shined through the entrance slit.
 Due to diffraction, the light fan out as it propagates to the collimating
 concave mirror where light is collimated and reflected in the direction
 of the diffraction grating.
 The diffraction grating then, deviates light from each different wavelength
 (optical frequencies) into different angles following the equation

 A focusing concave mirror focus the light coming from the diffraction grating
 and deflect it to the detector slit.

The function of the entrance slit is to filter spatial optical modes that
 are inputed into the system.
 For best filtering the slit has to transmit only a single spatial mode.
 This is achieved by making the slit width of the order of the light wavelength.
 Decreasing slit width will increase the beam spread angle, as depicted
 in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:different slits"

\end_inset

, for a chosen final beam width this will allow the collimating concave
 mirror to placed nearer to the slit decreasing the device size.
 However, decrease the slit width will also decrease the fraction of transmitted
 light.
 and therefore, lowering the device sensitivity.

\begin_layout Standard
To quantify the amount of light deviated to each different direction, we
 use a focusing concave mirror, which will map light with different direction
 and focus them each into a distinct point in a plane.
 Alternatively we can say that light in different k in the k space into
 different points in the coordinate space.
 Clearly, the size of the focusing mirror must be such that it collects
 most of the light coming from the diffraction grating.
 This means that it must be bigger than the beam size plus account for the
 spread of different wavelengths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A detector is placed at a point in the focus plan to measure the light power.
 Optimum detector size is of the order of the entrance slit width, limited
 also by the resolving power of the diffraction grating.
 Placing a exit slit in the focus plane followed by a detector, can be used
 as an alternative for the slit size detector.

The design consists in the use of a concave diffraction grating of radius
 2R.
 The entrance and exit slits positions are located in a circle of radius
 R tangent to the diffraction grating sphere.
 Or more precisely tangent to one of the equator of the diffraction grating
 sphere.
 For optimum area usage, the equator should be perpendicular to the diffraction
 grating grooves and passing through the grating center.

, this limitation can be overcome by replacing the grating grooves by an
 array of waveguides.
 To understand how the introduction of waveguide help it is necessary to
 understand more generally what diffraction order is.
 We say that certain diffraction peak is of order 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 if each wave from the set that was constructively interfered to form the
 interference peak is delayed from one another of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$

 On traditional ruled surface diffraction gratings, wavefront from different
 period are made to interfere by making the wave travel different path lengths
 by taking path that deviates from the equal angle reflection.

\begin_layout Standard
By guiding light through waveguide it is possible to increase the difference
 of path length among different waveguides, achieved by only changing the
 waveguides lengths.
 Each waveguide of the waveguide array would function like a groove in the
 diffraction grating, but since waveguide length is only limited by its
 intrinsic loss, the difference of path length can be on the order of hundreds
 of wavelength, giving raise to grating that operate of diffraction order
 of also hundreds.

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately there is a drawback of increasing diffraction order, the free
 spectral range as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:FSR"

\end_inset

, decreases with the inverse of the of the diffraction order.
 For instance, an arrayed waveguide grating working on diffraction order
 100 at wavelength 1500 nm would have a FSR of only 15 nm.
 Although this range is useful for fiber optics telecommunications, this
 bandwidth is too small for most spectroscopy application, optical coherence
 tomography or ultra-fast oscilloscope[refs].
 Since we want to achieve a wide spectrum range, this architecture is not
 fit for us.

On section

, it was assumed that the whole grating was uniformly illuminated.
 In practice, this case not always occurs.
 Light source is normally a collimated light from a slit, pin hole or fiber
 optics, where for best resolution, single mode output should pass through.
 In those cases the tranversal power profile is better modeled by a gaussian
 than by a square profile, see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 To ajust the resolving power equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 to account for the Gaussian profile illumination we have to alter the squared
 illumination assumption in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Using the relation we can equate 
\begin_inset Formula \[
U\left(p\right)=U^{\left(0\right)}\left(p\right)\int\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\delta\left(x-n\right)\text{rect}\left[\frac{x}{2\left(N-1\right)}\right]e^{-ikxdp}dx\]

the rect
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x\right)$

 function correspond to the squared illumination assumption, for a Gaussian

performing the integral we obtain a comb of Gaussian 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}

Rowland ghosts are spurious lines seen in some grating spectra that result
 from periodic errors in the spacing of the grooves.

 line at a spectral distance from it, which depends on the period of the
 error, and with an intensity that depends on the amplitude of this error.

\begin_layout Standard
The resolving power equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq: resolving power"

\end_inset

 states that the resolution of a diffraction grating depends linearly with
 the wavelength.
 Unfortunatelly, that relation is only valid for plane waves.
 To use segregation capability of the diffraction grating, it is necessary
 to have a source of plane waves and to measure the light power that go
 to different direction after diffraction from the grating.
 Sources and detector are space localized endpoints.
 But employing lenses, it is possible to convert a space localized mode
 to a angle localized mode., as discussed on the Czerny-Turner configuration
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Czerny-Turner"

\end_inset

.
 This conversion, however, is not perfect.
 In geometrical optics terms, this means that rays that enter parallel in
 a lens (or any other focusin device) does no converge to a single point
 after the lens and with the fase arriving at exaclty the same time(picture?).
 Integrating the lens into the grating, as done in Rowland configuration
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, does not readily eliminate the problem, but its application together with
 the potencial to fabricate designs with freedom to choose any geometry

 demultiplexer (WDM) integrated with detectors and electronic amplifiers.
 Most silicon-on-insulator (SOI) WDMs with 1 nm channel spacing typically
 cover a spectral range of only 10 nm.
 The small spectral range in typical WDMs is due to the use of arrayed waveguide

 It is possible to increase the spectral range by lowering the grating order
 and adding more waveguides to compensate, but this increases the overall
 chip size.
 Furthermore, due to the high index contrast of the silicon photonics platform,
 the achievable resolution depends on very fine control of the AWG waveguide
 dimensions.

 This design is more fabrication tolerant since light is propagating in
 a slab where the only dimension that needs to be controlled is the slab
 thickness.
 It is also more suitable to work at a low grating order because light diffracts
 in a single slab opposed to the two star couplers slabs in the AWG.

We designed a WDM that uses a Rowland design with one stigmatic point correction.
 The system was designed so that stigmatic point was located at the central
 waveguide of the 21 output waveguide array.
 The central wavelength was chosen to be 1500 nm and the diffraction order
 was 10.
 The Rowland circle was chosen to be 750 μm.
 The designed grating contains 340 grooves.
 The resulting free spectral range was estimated to be 117 nm, and the groove
 spacing approximately 4 μm.
 The input and output waveguide apertures were 1.4 μm.
 A reference waveguide was placed next to the spectrometer so that the transmiss
ion efficiency could be estimated.

Due to the readly avaibility of testing equipment operating at 1460-1610

 Germanium detector have a peak detection at 1500 nm so we decided to design
 the spectrometer operating range centered at 1500 nm.

 The system is capable of writing using only beam deflecton on an area (denomina

 By moving the sample to be written (process called as

 Unfortunatelly due to the extreme precision required, it is difficult to
 align the boders of neighboring fields perfectly, with the system working
 its best alignments of 10 nm are possible, though achieving this kind of
 precision is requires a good amount of trials and experience, alignments
 of 50 nm are more routinelly achieved.
 In order to avoid errors in the spectrometer grating during stitching we
 limited the size of the grating in order of it to fit in a single 1x1 mm
 field, which meant placing the grating along the diagonal of the field,
 which, ignoring the grating curvature, gaves us a grating size of 1.4 mm.

We measured the performance of our WDM and observed -10 dB crosstalk and
 1 nm channel spacing across 21 channels.
 As shown in Fig.
 2, a relatively flat transmission spectrum was obtained.
 This result was measured by inserting light from a tunable laser and measuring
 the power from the output waveguides.
 A fiber polarization controller was used to set the input polarization
 to TE and a polarizer was placed between the chip output and the detector
 to filter out any TM polarized light.
 An insertion loss of -10 dB was estimated by comparing to the transmission
 through the reference waveguide.
 This can be attributed to Fresnel reflection between the Si-SiO2 interfaces
 at the grating groove facet and can be reduced by coating the grating facets
 with a reflective metal.

How can we use resonators to make spectrometer.
 An array of resonators can be used.
 But fabrication limits prevent its use without requiring individually tuning
 each resonator.
 Grating spectrometers uses a lot of space.
 Is there a middle way.
 Yes! we can use small free spectral range resonators and a grating spectrometer.
 The device described in this chapter was published on optics express and
 presented on the Conference of Lasers and Electro-Optics 2010 (CLEO) as
 a invited paper and received and honorable mention in the Maiman Student

Device Theory

\begin_layout Standard
The principle of operation consists of using a resonator to pre-filter the
 light to be analyzed by a diffraction grating spectrometer as shown in
 figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Fig:resonator-enhanced-principle"

\end_inset

.
 The resonator transmits only the resonant wavelengths.
 A diffraction grating spectrometer is then used to route light from different
 resonances into distinct output channels.
 The net effect is that the final resonator and diffraction grating spectrometer
 line width will be equal to the resonator line width.
 On silicon ring resonators cladded with silicon dioxide, line width as
 narrow as 30 pm are routinely achieved[ref].
 Therefore, enabling the possibility of creating 30 pm resolution spectrometers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To achieve this, the resonator and the spectrometer must be designed so
 that the channel spacing of the diffraction grating spectrometer matches
 the ring resonator FSR.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The spectrometer must be designed so that each output channel only allows
 to transmit a single resonance.
 Therefore the spectrometer channel spacing must be equal to the resonator
 FSR.

Testing

\begin_layout Standard
We measure the device transmission spectrum by coupling laser light from
 a tunable laser into the input waveguide using a lensed fiber and measuring
 the transmitted power as a function of wavelength.
 The input light is TE polarized and the output light is collected using
 a microscope objective and filtered for the TE polarization before detection.
 We achieve a channel FWHM of 0.05 nm across 10 different channels of the
 composed ring and EDG spectrometer, which represents a decrease in the
 channel width by 10 times compared with the DG spectrometer alone.
 This channel width corresponds to a quality factor of Q = 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda/\Delta\lambda$
\end_inset

= 30000.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 3(b) shows the device transmission.
 The transmission is normalized to the ring through port power level to
 eliminate coupling losses.
 The device insertion loss varies between -18 and -23 dB, where -10 dB is
 due to the Fresnel reflection of the diffraction grating and can be eliminated
 by coating it with a metal or using Bragg reflectors 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Brouckaert:2008p108"

\end_inset

.
 Other losses are attributed to stitching in the waveguide definition during
 e-beam lithography.
 A small mismatch between the resonator FSR (0.97 nm) and the DG spectrometer
 channel spacing (1 nm) cause a misalignment between the resonance and the
 DG spectrometer channel that builds up from one channel to the next in
 a Vernier effect.
 The outcome is a misalignment between the 11th spectrometer channel and
 the 11th ring resonance.
 Therefore only 10 of the 25 channels on the DG spectrometer are used.
 This issue can be eliminated by more detailed characterization of fabrication.

Serializing devices either spatially or in time can increase the spectrometer
 channel density.
 The space serialization approach consists of using multiple combined ring-DG
 spectrometers, so that the input of a spectrometer is connected to the
 through port of the previous device, as shown in Fig.
 4(a).
 The peak wavelength of each spectrometer is shifted relative to the others.
 The number of devices needed in order to achieve the a spectral density
 where the channels are separated by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\lambda_{FWHM}$
\end_inset

, is equal to the DG spectrometer channel width divided by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\lambda_{FWHM}$
\end_inset

.
 In spite of the area increase, this approach is still more compact than
 using a traditional diffraction grating spectrometer since in this proposed
 approach the area increases linearly with resolution as opposed to quadratic
 in traditional DGs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In time serialization, Fig.
 4(b), only a single combined spectrometer is used and the output spectrum
 is measured several times.
 In each measurement the device transmission spectrum is shifted.
 Notice that this approach also requires active tuning of the ring and the
 EDG spectrometer.
 By applying the time serialization technique we were able to reduce the
 channel spacing from 0.97 nm to 0.097 nm, and were able to measure 100 channels
 using the device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A zoom in on the series of channels is depicted in Fig.
 6 (a).
 Figure 6 (b) shows a density plot where each horizontal line corresponds
 to the transmission spectrum of each channel.
 Notice that the overlap of the residual transmission from the DG spectrometer
 with the neighboring resonances can be seen in the side diagonal lines,
 and their transmissions are at least 10 dB lower than the peak (main diagonal
 line).

Effect of transmission spectrum lineshape
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect that the transmission lineshape causes on the output spectrum
 is that the final measured spectrum is the convolution of the real spectrum
 with the channel transmission spectrum.
 The basic consquence is the limitation of the spectroemter resolution.
 For systems where the desired data is the Fourier transform of the output,
 such as optical coherence tomography and ultra fast osciloscope, the transmissi
on spectrum linshape will cause a roll of as the frequency increases in
 the Fourier transmorm graph.
 This is due to the

\begin_layout Standard
If the aperture 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}$
\end_inset

 is much smaller than 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, then we can consider that 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos\left(r,m\right)$
\end_inset

 does not vary a lot in the integral, therefore we can pull it outside the
 integral, which convert the integral to 
\begin_inset Formula $U\left(P\right)$
\end_inset

.
 We therefore can simplify the equations to
\begin_inset Formula \[
\begin{cases}
U\left(P\right)=\int_{\mathbb{Q}}\frac{e^{\text{i}kr}}{\sqrt{kr}}\left[\frac{ikU\left(Q\right)}{2}\cos\left(r,n\right)-\frac{\partial U\left(Q\right)}{\partial n}\right]dS\\
\frac{\partial U\left(P\right)}{\partial m}=\frac{ik}{2}\cos\left(r,m\right)U\left(P\right)\end{cases}\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\partial U\left(P\right)}{\partial m}=\frac{ik}{2}\cos\left(r,m\right)\int_{\mathbb{Q}}\frac{e^{\text{i}kr}}{\sqrt{kr}}\left[U\left(Q\right)\frac{ik}{2}\cos\left(r,n\right)-\frac{\partial U\left(Q\right)}{\partial n}\right]dS=\frac{ik}{2}\cos\left(r,m\right)U\left(P\right)\]

\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\vec{r'}-\vec{v}\right|=\sqrt{r'^{2}+v^{2}+r'v\cos\left(r,v\right)}=r'\sqrt{1+\frac{v^{2}}{r'^{2}}+\frac{v}{r'}\cos\left(r,v\right)}\]

\end_inset
